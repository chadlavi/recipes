# Eighteenth-century-style Rum Punch

Similar to [Philadelphia Fish House Punch](./philadelphia-fish-house-punch).

As described by Sam Meyer:

> Do the oleo-saccharum with the three lemons and dissolve it in the lemon juice. Add a bottle of – well, any spirit, really, but an aged rum with some funkiness is nice – and a bottle's worth of water, or seltzer, or even a mix of water and strong green or black tea (consider using decaf if you don't want wired drunks), or bubbly wine if you fancy, add a big ice block (I freeze water in soup containers or Bundt pans), grate a bunch of nutmeg over the top, and stand back.

## Ingredients

* 6oz white sugar
* 6oz strained lemon juice (from the lemons)

## Directions
