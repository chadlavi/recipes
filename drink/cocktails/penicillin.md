# Penicillin

## Ingredients
* 2 ounces blended Scotch whisky (Famous Grouse works well)
* 3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
* 3/4 ounce honey syrup (see note)
* 3 slices fresh ginger
* 1/4 ounce Islay single malt Scotch (such as Laphroaig)

## Directions
1. Using a wooden muddler or mixing spoon, muddle the fresh ginger in the bottom of a cocktail shaker until it is well mashed. Add the blended Scotch, lemon juice, and honey syrup, and fill shaker with ice. Shake untill well chilled, about 20 seconds.
2. Strain into an ice-filled rocks glass (you may wish to double-strain through a fine tea strainer to remove the small flecks of ginger), and pour the Islay Scotch over the back of a bar spoon so that it floats atop the drink.
