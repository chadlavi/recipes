# Whiskey Rebellion Punch

From Sam Meyer

## Ingredients

* 3 bottles 100-proof rye whiskey (I used Rittenhouse. If you have cask-strength whiskey, go with the proportions of whiskey and water given above.)
* 16 oz. Jamaica rum (I used the nicely funky 114-proof Smith & Cross)
* 8 lemons (Wondrich suggests upping the amount of lemons to 8, following the suggestion of the 1869 Haney's Steward and Barkeeper's Manual)
* 1 pineapple
* 3 liters seltzer
* 12 oz. white granulated or superfine sugar

## Directions

1. Slice the pineapple and the lemons thinly, and place them in a pot with the spirits. Cover and let infuse overnight (without squeezing the fruit.)
2. Make a simple syrup with 12 oz. sugar and 12 oz. water (which will result in about 20 oz. of the 1:1 syrup) and set aside. (If you need to transport it, take the fruit out with a slotted spoon and put it in a quart-size food storage bag, and bottle the infused spirits in the bottles you emptied.)
3. To serve, mix the fruit, the infused spirits, the simple syrup, and the seltzer together, and slip in a large ice block. Garnish each serving with a piece of the pineapple and a slice of lemon.
