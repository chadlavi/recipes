# David Wondrich's Royal Hibernian Punch
Requires prep work ahead of time (3-12 hours). Shared by Sam Meyer.

## Ingredients
* 3 lemons
* 6oz white sugar
* 6oz strained lemon juice (from the lemons)
* 12oz madeira (recommended: Sandeman Rainwater Madeira)
* 750ml filtered water
* 750ml Jameson Irish whiskey
* fresh nutmeg

## Directions
1. Prepare an oleo-saccharum with the peel of three lemons and 6 ounces of white sugar:
    1. peel the lemons (trying to not get much white pith on them) and put the peels in a jar with the sugar and let them sit for at least three hours and preferably overnight.
2. Add 6 ounces strained lemon juice and stir until the sugar has dissolved.
3. Add the resulting lemon base to 12 ounces Madeira, stir and pour the Madeira shrub into a clean 750-milliliter bottle. Add enough water to the bottle to fill it, seal and refrigerate.
4. To serve, pour the bottle of the shrub, 750ml filtered water, and one 750-milliliter bottle of Irish whiskey into a gallon Punch bowl, add a 1 1/2 quart block of ice and grate nutmeg over the top.
