# Tony B's Cooler Full Of Wine

## Ingredients

* 750ml white wine (gerwurtzraminer works well)
* 1 container frozen lemonade concentrate
* 2l club soda
* 1/2 bag ice
* optional: sliced citrus fruits

## Directions

Place all liquid ingredients in large cooler and stir. If using sliced fruit, add it last so it stays on top and doesn't clog the spigot. Do not put the top back on until the soda has had a few minutes to fizz off.
