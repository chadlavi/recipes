# Bottled Manhattan

Fits perfectly in a 20oz swingtop bottle, or with some room to spare in a 750ml bottle.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups 100-proof rye whiskey (such as Rittenhouse)
* 1 cup water
* 2/3 cup sweet vermouth (such Carpano Antica Formula)
* 6 dashes Angostura bitters
* Orange peel twists, for garnish
* Maraschino cherries (such as Luxardo), for garnish

## Directions

1. Stir together whiskey, 1 cup water, vermouth, and bitters in a large spouted measuring cup. Pour mixture into a freezer-safe glass bottle or container; secure lid. Freeze at least overnight or up to 1 month. Move to refrigerator 1 hour before serving.
2. To serve, pour about 1/2 cup whiskey mixture into each of 6 cocktail glasses. Garnish with orange peel twists and maraschino cherries.
