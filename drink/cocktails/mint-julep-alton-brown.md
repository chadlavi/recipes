# Mint Julep
Alton Brown's recipe

## Ingredients
* 7 fresh mint leaves (plus 1 sprig for garnish)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons demerara sugar
* 2 1/2 ounces Kentucky bourbon whiskey
* Ice cubes
* Seltzer water

## Directions
1. Tear any large mint leaves into pieces, then combine mint leaves and the sugar in an old-fashioned glass or metal julep cup.
2. Muddle these together with a muddler or back of a spoon for approximately 1 minute so the leaves release their essential oils but are still green.
3. Add the bourbon and set aside for 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, wrap the ice cubes up in a clean towel and pound with a rolling pin to crush.
5. Fill the glass with ice and top with a splash of seltzer water.
6. Stir, garnish with remaining mint sprig, and serve immediately.
