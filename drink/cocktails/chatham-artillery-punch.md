# Chatham Artillery Punch

Nota bene: this is **strong**. As warned by Sam Meyer:

> be careful with Artillery Punch, as the poem says:
>
> _If you visit the town of Savannah  
> Enlist 'neath the temperance bannah  
> For if you should lunch  
> On Artillery Punch  
> 'T'will treat you in powerful mannah_

Requires a large (2.5 gallon) serving vessel

## Ingredients

* 12 lemons
* 2 cups light, raw sugar
* 750-milliliter bottle cognac
* 750-milliliter bottle bourbon
* 750-milliliter bottle Jamaica rum
* 3 750-milliliter bottles Champagne or sparkling wine, chilled
* 5 pound bag cracked ice

## Directions

1. Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, peel the lemons, being careful to remove only the yellow peel and not the bitter white pith.
2. Place the peels in a bowl, add the sugar and muddle to combine. Set aside for at least half an hour, preferably an hour, to let the flavors combine.
3. While the lemon peel is resting, juice the lemons to make two cups lemon juice. After the lemon peel has rested, add lemon juice to the bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Strain the mixture into an empty 750mL bottle.
4. Add water to the bottle to fill, seal it, give it a little shake and refrigerate this shrub until you're ready to make your punch.
5. To serve, fill your large (2.5 gallon) punch bowl with cracked ice. (At this point, move your punch bowl to its party-time location, as it will be very difficult to move when it's full of punch.)
6. Pour the shrub and all of the bottles of cognac, bourbon, rum and sparkling wine onto the ice. Stir to combine. Serve.
