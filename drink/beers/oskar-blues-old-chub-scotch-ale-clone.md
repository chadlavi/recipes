## Notes

From original recipe:
> We turn this beer out in about 15 days usually. I recommend at least 3 weeks for a homebrewed verSIon. 1t‘s important to maintain fermentatlon tem- perature below 70 ”F (21 DC) to keep esters (rom getting out of control.  Ensure no diacetyl left in beer before cooling fermented beer (if you indeed do that). To do this. put a small beer sam- ple in a sealabte jar. Immerse jar in 170 °F (77 “(3) water bath until the sample is 170 °F (77 °C). holding for 15 minutes.  Cool jar to room temperature in a cool water bath, then smell sample. If you detect any buttery notes, continue to age beer at room temperature and check again the next day. Cool beer once diacetyl is not detected.
