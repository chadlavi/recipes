# Spicy Lime Leaf Beer Nuts 

## Ingredients
* 1 cup peanut oil, for frying
* 10 large fresh kaffir lime leaves (see Note)
* 8 small dried red chiles
* 6 cups raw peanuts (2 pounds)
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* 4 large garlic cloves, minced

## Directions
1. In a very large skillet, heat the peanut oil. Line a plate with paper towels. Add the lime leaves and chiles to the skillet and fry over moderate heat until the lime leaves are crisp and the chiles turn deep red, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the lime leaves and chiles to the paper towels to drain.
2. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Add the peanuts to the skillet and stir-fry over moderate heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peanuts to the paper towels to drain. Transfer the hot peanuts to a bowl and toss with the salt.
3. Add the garlic to the skillet and fry over moderate heat until golden, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or fine mesh skimmer, transfer the garlic to the plate with the lime leaves and chiles and pat dry.
4. Using your hands, finely crush the lime leaves and chiles over the peanuts. Add the garlic and toss to combine. Transfer the peanuts to small bowls and serve warm or at room temperature.
