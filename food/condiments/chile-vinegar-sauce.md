# Chile Vinegar Sauce

## Ingredients
* 1 dried Anaheim chile
* 1 fresh red Fresno chile, sliced ¼-inch thick
* ½ red bell pepper, sliced ¼-inch thick
* 2 tablespoons roughly chopped garlic
* ¼ cup finely diced shallot
* 1 cup white vinegar
* 2 tablespoons salt

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Roast the Anaheim chile on a sheet tray until lightly toasted, about a minute.
2. Combine all of the ingredients in a non-reactive mixing bowl and allow to marinate for an hour.
3. Transfer the chile mixture to a blender and purée on high speed until smooth. Place the purée in a nonreactive bowl and cover tightly with one layer of cheesecloth. Allow the sauce to sit at room temperature for 3 to 5 days until the sauce takes on a natural fermented aroma. Once finished, transfer the sauce to an airtight container. Keep chilled in the refrigerator. The vinegar will last for a few months.
