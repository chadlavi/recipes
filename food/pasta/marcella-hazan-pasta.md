# Pasta dough (Marcella Hazan)

This is more of a ratio than a recipe.

The ratio about 1 egg to every 1 cup of AP flour. This will make enough pasta for 2 people.

The number of eggs you use will depend on the size of the eggs and the humidity of the day. If the dough is too dry, add a little water. If it is too wet, add a little flour.

Make a well in the center of the flour and crack the egg(s) into the well. Mix the eggs and flour together until a dough forms. Knead the dough for 10 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. Roll out the dough and cut it into the desired shape.
