# Semolina pasta dough

## Ingredients

- 1 pound (about 2 3/4 cups) semolina flour
- 12 ounces (about 2 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup water
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 tablespoons pure olive oil

## Directions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine all of the dry ingredients. Create a well in the center of the bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the water, yolks, and oil together. Place the wet mixture in the well of the dry ingredients and mix together by hand until a crumbly dough forms.
3. Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Press it together into 1 somewhat crumbly dough ball and then knead it by hand 15-20 minutes, until a smooth dough ball forms. If the dough will not stay together, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you have a smooth dough ball.
4. Tightly wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow it to relax in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.
5. For basic pappardelle: divide dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece as thin as possible (it will roll out to about 12"x16") and cut into 1/4" strips. Toss strips with flour to keep from sticking. Cook noodles for 1.5 to 2 minutes in well-salted boiling water.
