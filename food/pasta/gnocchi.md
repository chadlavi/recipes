# Gnocchi

I learned this recipe at a small private cooking school in the Amalfi Coast in Italy.

## Ingredients
* 1kg potatoes (a mix of white and red)
* 300g of tipo-00 flour
* 100g of semolina flour

## Directions
1. Wash potatoes carefully, and boil in salted water until they are fork-soft
2. When the potatoes are ready, crush in a potato ricer and allow them to cool
3. Mix the tipo-00 and semolina flour with the cooled riced potatoes until homogeneous
4. Without using additional flour, roll the potato mixture into ropes about the thickness of a finger
5. Lightly flour the ropes, and cut them into small sections (about as long as the width of your thumb)
6. Form the gnocchi by rolling a piece of the resulting potato mixture with your thumb downwards along the ridged side of a rigagnocchi, or downwards along the back of the tines of a fork
7. Cook gnocchi in salted boiling water until they begin to float (around 2-3 minutes)

Mix with tomato sauce, then add mozzarella, parmesan and basil.
