## Ingredients
* 1 pound linguine (any other pasta is fine and fresh is ideal since sauces cling better to fresh pasta)
* kosher salt
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped finely
* 1 shallot, chopped finely
* 1 35-ounce can Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano) with liquid
* kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen peas
* 1/4 lb sliced prosciutto (taste it before buying, you don’t want it too salty)
* 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or freshly grated Parmesan cheese..
* red hot pepper flakes (optional, the amount depending on how hot you like it)
* chopped fresh Italian parsley (optional)

## Directions
1.  In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water plus a generous pinch plus of kosher salt to a boil (about 1 tablespoon per 2  quarts water, so 3 tablespoons in this case).  Taste the water, it should be salty like the ocean.
2. While waiting for the water to boil, pour the can of tomatoes with juice into the work bowl of a food processor.  DO NOT turn on the processor at full speed because you will end up with pink foam.  Just pulse until you have a smooth puree.
3. Over medium heat, heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large, deep pan or skillet.  Add the chopped garlic and chopped shallot to the oil.  Saute until soft and translucent, then slowly pour in the pureed tomatoes and their juice.  Bring the tomato sauce to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer, seasoning it with salt and pepper to taste as it simmers (go easy on the salt because of the cheese that will be added).  If you’re using the red hot pepper flakes, add them now.  Simmer until it reduces a bit about 10 to 15 minutes tops.
4. While the tomato sauce simmers, add the linguine to the boiling pot of water and cook until al dente (about 6 to 8 minutes, keep checking by biting into a strand).  In the mean time, once the sauce has simmered for 10-15 minutes, stir the 2 tablespoons of butter, then add the peas and let them cook for 2 to 4 minutes, depending on their size (fresh peas are bigger).  Slowly pour the cream into the sauce, swirling the pan and stirring, then add the sliced prosciutto, stirring to distribute it evenly.
5.  Immediately drain the linguine, pouring some of the pasta water into a cup in case you need to thin the sauce once the cheese is added.  If your pan or skillet is big enough, dump all the linguine right into the sauce and toss, adding all the parmigiano-reggiano cheese at once and tossing over the heat until it coats the linguine.  If your skillet or pan isn’t big enough, dump the pasta into a large bowl and pour the sauce and cheese on top of it, tossing until all the pasta is coated.
    * If the sauce is too thick once tossed with the linguine, thin it out with some of the reserved pasta water.
6.  Top with the chopped parsley (if using), some extra fresh ground pepper, and serve immediately, passing extra Parmigiano-Reggiano or freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
