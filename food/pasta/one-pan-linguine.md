## Ingredients
* 12 ounces linguine

* 1 onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
* 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 1/2- 3/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
* 2 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for garnish
* 2-3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
* kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 4 1/2 cups water
* Lots of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving

## Directions
Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, red-pepper flakes, basil, oil, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and water in a large straight-sided skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat.
