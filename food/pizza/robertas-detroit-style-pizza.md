# Roberta's pizza, Detroit-style
This recipe makes 1 Detroit-style pizza in a 10x14 pan. Give yourself at least 12 hours but ideally 1-2 full days for the dough to cold ferment in the fridge. 

## Dough Ingredients
* 153 grams 00 flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon)
* 153 grams all-purpose flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons)
* 8 grams fine sea salt(1 teaspoon)
* 2 grams active dry yeast (3/4 teaspoon)
* 4 grams extra-virgin olive oil (1 teaspoon)

## Other Ingredients
* Shredded low-moisture Mozzarella *and or*
  * Queso Oaxaca *and or*
  * Shredded Monterey Jack 
* Jarred Marinara sauce
* Oregano
* (optional) Bread Crumbs
* Whatever toppings you want (pepperoni is the classic choice)

### Preparation (at least 12 hours before you plan to cook, ideally 24-48h before)
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.
2. In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (about 1 cup) lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.
3. Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Shape into a ball, and put it in a bowl with a little oil, turning to coat. Put plastic wrap on the dough (pressed down onto the dough, so there's no air touching it), and refrigerate for a day or two. Three days would probably also be ok.

### Cookin' it
1. Grease a 10x14 pan with 2" tall sides with Crisco (ideally) or butter (also ok).
2. Remove dough from the fridge and stretch it into a roughly rectangular shape, then place it in the pan, stretching and pushing the dough to completely cover the bottom of the pan and fill the corners.
3. Move a rack to the lowest position in your oven, and preheat it to 550ยบ or as close as your oven gets to that.
4. Let the dough come to room temperature and rise on the counter (this usually takes an hour or more). 
5. Lift up the edges of the dough to get any large bubbles out, then sprinkle some oregano on the dough, then add cheese. The one you use is up to you, but queso Oaxaca (cubed or pulled apart) or shredded low-moisture Mozzarella do the best for the distinctive baked-cheese rim that's characteristic of Detroit-style pizza. Be sure that the cheese goes all the way to the edges; in fact, you'll want to put a nice little rim of cheese all the way around the edges.
6. Put your toppings on top of the cheese, but try to keep it light. If you want extra crunch, add some breadcrumbs.
7. Bake 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese around the edges is blackened and the cheese in the middle is starting to brown. 
8. After baking, use a flexible metal spatula or a knife to loosen the edges of the pizza; it should snap cleanly off the walls of your pan. Lift and slide the pizza onto a cutting board, and spoon three lines of sauce across the pizza (or whatever arrangement you want; point here is: put sauce on, not too much). If the pizza's looking juicy, let it sit for a few minutes; cut into 6 squares and enjoy!
