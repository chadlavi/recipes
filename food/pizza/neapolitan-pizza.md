## Directions

### Poolish

1. In a large container add the water, honey, and yeast. Mix to dissolve the yeast.
2. Next, add in the flour and mix until there are no dry spots. Let it sit for 15 minutes, uncovered.
3. Seal it and let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
4. Place in the fridge overnight or anywhere from 16 – 24 hours but nothing more otherwise it will become acidic.

### Dough

1. In a large bowl add all of the poolish, bread flour, and 00 flour.
2. In a measuring cup add in water and salt. Mix to dissolve salt.
3. Integrate the flour into the polish while adding the water little by little.
4. You should have a very wet dough once all of the water has been added.
5. Now, dump out the dough onto a clean surface and start working it. Click the video to see how Vito does it.
6. After, you have worked the dough you should be left with a more cohesive yet shaggy dough. Cover it with a little bit of oil and let it sit for 15 minutes.
7. Now, gently detach the dough from the counter and shape into a tight bowl.
8. Cover with olive and a damp towel. Let it sit for 1 hour.
9. Now, that the dough is ready. Cut into 250 – 280 gram pieces. Gently shape into a ball. Click here to see how Vito does it!
10. Place the dough balls onto a baking tray, keeping them four fingers apart.
11. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 1 – 2 hours.
12. Now, you are ready to make some pizza.

### Sauce

1. In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients.
2. Crush the tomatoes by hand and make sure to leave some chunks of tomatoes. Set aside.

### Pizza

1. Dust your dough ball with some flour and using a small spatula, gently lift out the dough into a bowl of flour. Wrap the rest of the dough balls so they don’t dry out and put them away.
2. Dredge the dough ball in some flour then transfer to your work surface. Take the dough ball that is now coated in flour and press out the dough. See how Vito does it here.
3. Then spoon the sauce right in the center and gently swirl it out. Grate some parmesan on top, followed by mozzarella, basil, and olive oil.
4. Using a pizza peel, transfer the pizza to your oven and bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.
5. To finish off the pizza, grate some more parmesan over top, top with torn basil, and a drizzle of olive oil.
