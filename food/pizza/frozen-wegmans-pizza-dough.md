# Frozen Wegman's pizza dough grandma pie

## Ingredients

- 1 frozen Wegman's pizza dough ball
- 1/2 bag finely shredded mozzarella
- 3/4 small ball fresh mozzarella, finely diced
- 1 small can pomodori pelati
- cupping pepperoni (like Hormel)
- dried oregano
- diamond crystal kosher salt
- olive oil
- spicy honey (optional)

## Directions

1. Thaw dough ball in refrigerator overnight
2. Remove thawed dough from refrigerator and open its enclosing plastic bag. Generously oil a half sheet pan and your hands, then transfer dough to the pan. Give it a few turns to coat with oil.
3. Stretch the dough gently towards the shape of the pan. This will take several tries with 15-20 minute pauses between each. Cover the entire pan rim to rim with Saran Wrap (this may take two sheets overlapping) between stretches. Once the dough is mostly a flat sheet, an effective stretching strategy is to lift the edge or corner of the dough, reach underneath with an upturned (well-oiled) hand, and slide your hand out along the bottom of the dough, with the tips of the fingers angled slightly upwards.
4. Once the dough is sufficiently stretched to comfortably fill the pan when it is relaxed, arrange unglazed terra cotta tiles (or pizza stone or equivalent) on a rack in the topmost position in your oven, and place an empty rack two positions (or about 4") below that. Preheat the open to 450°F.
5. Prepare the sauce: empty the small can of pomadori pelati into the cup of a stick blender, then add about a tablespoon of olive oil, about a teaspoon of diamond crystal kosher salt, and roughly a teaspoon of dried oregano. These measurements are approximate and needn't be fussed over. Use the stick blender to combine on low, until no longer stringy but not so long as to liquefy; small chunks are the goal.
6. If necessary, slice the pepperoni. Slices that are about 1/8" thick are ideal for cupping.
7. After the oven reaches 450°F, let it continue to preheat for 20 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, dress the pizza for the first baking period: use a large dining spoon to evenly spatter a thin layer of sauce on the pizza, smoothing it out with the back of the spoon. This should be thin enough that it's more or less painted on. Sprinkle all of the finely grated mozzarella evenly over the entire pizza, all the way to the edge. Arrange the sliced pepperoni evenly over the pizza.
8. Bake 7 minutes on the rack beneath the tiles/pizza stone.
9. After 7 minutes, remove the pizza and add the finely diced fresh mozzarella and more small dollops of sauce (put them in the least saucy areas; do not spread them this time). Bake for another 9-10 minutes, or until the fresh mozzarella is completely melted and starting to brown, the pepperoni cups are starting to get dark brown at their rims, and any exposed crust is browned.
10. Remove from the oven and turn off the oven. Add a few more dollops of fresh sauce and sprinkle the entire pizza with a pinch of dried oregano and a pinch of diamond crystal kosher salt. If using, drizzle a very thin stream of hot honey evenly over the entire pizza. Let rest for 15 minutes.
11. Loosen the edges and bottom of the pizza from the pan with a slotted spatula (there may be a few sticking spots but overall it should release easily and have a well-browned bottom crust). Remove to a large cutting board and cut into 8 large pieces (2 rows of 4) or 16 small pieces (4 rows of 4; four of these will be crustless center pieces).
