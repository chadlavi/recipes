# Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs
## Ingredients
* 5 pounds bone-in beef short ribs, cut crosswise into 2' pieces
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 3 medium onions, chopped
* 3 medium carrots, peeled, chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 750-ml bottle dry red wine (preferably Cabernet Sauvignon)
* 10 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
* 8 sprigs thyme
* 4 sprigs oregano
* 2 sprigs rosemary
* 2 fresh or dried bay leaves
* 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
* 4 cups low-salt beef stock

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350°. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer short ribs to a plate. Pour off all but 3 Tbsp. drippings from pot.
2. Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until well combined and deep red, 2-3 minutes. Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated juices. Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes. Add all herbs to pot along with garlic. Stir in stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven.
3. Cook until short ribs are tender, 2–2 1/2 hours. Transfer short ribs to a platter. Strain sauce from pot into a measuring cup. Spoon fat from surface of sauce and discard; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes with sauce spooned over.
