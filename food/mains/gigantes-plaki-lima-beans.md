## Ingredients
* 1 pound dried beans (gigantes or large lima beans)
* 1 1/2 cups chopped onion (approx 2 medium onions)
* 1/3 cup chopped garlic
* 1 cup chopped celery (approx 2-3 stalks)
* 3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1/3 cup chopped fresh mint
* 1 tbsp crushed, dried oregano
* 1 tbsp salt
* 2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
* 1 cup Greek olive oil
* 2 cups crushed tomatoes
* 2 cups reserved cooking water from beans
* 1 cup water, room temperature

## Directions
1. Soak dried beans overnight or at least 7 hours. Boil for 50 minutes and RESERVE 2 cups of cooking liquid before draining beans.
2. Saute chopped onions and celery in olive oil over medium low heat until tender. Add garlic and cook for a few minutes until soft. Add herbs and spices, mix to combine completely and cook for just a minute to combine flavor oils.
3. Add chopped tomatoes, stir to combine and cook for 5 minutes. Add reserved bean cooking liquid and bring sauce up to a boil.  Remove from heat and set aside until ready to bake the beans.
4. Layer cooked gigantes beans evenly in 9Ã—13 baking pan and pour sauce over top. Add 1 cup room temperature water and bake, uncovered, for 2 hours in 350 degree oven. Stir approximately every half hour or so.
5. Allow baked beans to rest for about 15-30 minutes before serving. Serve with crusty bread and a glass of buttery white wine for a most wonderful, traditional meal.
