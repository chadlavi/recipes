# Black eyed peas

Family holiday tradition: eat these on new year's day

## Ingredients

* 1lb bacon, chopped
* 1 medium yellow onion
* 3-6 cloves garlic, chopped
* one jalapeño, seeds removed, chopped
* about 1 cup dried black eyed peas, soaked overnight and drained
* bay leaves

## Directions

1. Put a heavy cast iron dutch oven over medium-low heat, and add the chopped
  bacon. Let cook until most of the fat has rendered out.
2. Add chopped onion, garlic, and jalapeño to the bacon and fat. Sauté until the
  onion is translucent and the jalapeño starts to break up.
3. Add a little water and stir, to dissolve and scrape up any fond that has
  formed.
4. Add the soaked black-eyed peas and enough water to cover them by an inch or
  so. Add a few bay leaves.
5. Bring the whole thing to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer for about 40
  minutes.
6. Try a bean to see if they're done, it should have an intact but easily burst
  skin, and it should be possible to crush it on the roof of the mouth with the
  tongue, with a creamy consistency inside. Continue to simmer until this is
  reached. Discard the bay leaves.
7. If there's a little too much liquid left, remove the lid and turn the heat up
  to high to boil it off. Bear in mind that the beans will absorb some liquid,
  so it's not necessary to cook all the liquid away.
8. Serve hot with rice and greens, or just by themselves with a spicy relish.
