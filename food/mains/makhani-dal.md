# Makhani Dal (Butter Dal), Mogul-Style

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup whole black garam beans (sabat urad)
* 2 tablespoons adzuki beans or pink beans (choti rajma)
* 2 tablespoons split chickpeas (chana dal)
* 1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt, whisked
* 2 cups finely chopped onions
* 1 1/2 cups finely chopped tomatoes (canned is fine)
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon ground-red-chili powder
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 3 tablespoons sunflower or safflower oil, or other neutral oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 3/4 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/2 cup plain low-fat yogurt

## Directions

1. Combine the legumes with 4 cups water in a large saucepan and bring to a boil; cook, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover the pot; let the legumes soak for 2 hours.
2. Add the whole-milk yogurt, 1 cup onions, tomatoes, ginger, turmeric, cardamom, paprika, chili and salt to the pot and bring to a boil once more. Cook, partly covered, over low heat for 90 minutes, or until the dal is very soft. Turn off the heat and use an Indian mathani or whisk to pur√©e the dal for about 1 minute; it should be saucy but not soupy.
3. To make the tadka, heat the oil in a small saucepan over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the remaining cup of onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until medium brown. Turn off the heat and stir in the cumin and garam masala.
4. Transfer the dal to a large bowl and cover with the low-fat yogurt; top with tadka, stir gently and serve.
