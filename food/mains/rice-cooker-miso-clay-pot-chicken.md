* 1 T white or red miso
* 1/2 t kosher salt
* 1/2 t sugar
* 1/2 t sesame oil

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, wine, miso, salt, sugar, sesame oil, and a few grinds of white pepper. Add the chicken and mushrooms and fold to coat.
2. Combine the rice, stock, and ginger in a rice cooker or a small Dutch oven.

* For a rice cooker:
    1. Scrape the chicken mixture and all of the marinade on top of the rice. Scatter with scallions.
    2. Cover, start the rice cooker, and cook until the cycle is done.
    3. Open the lid and check the chicken for doneness.Depending on your model, the chicken may need a couple more minutes to cook through. If it does, set the rice cooker for another cycle, press start, and check again in 5 minutes.
* For a Dutch oven:
    1. Place over medium heat and cook for 5 minutes, until just simmering.
    2. Reduce the heat to low and cook until all the liquid is absorbed and the chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes.
    3. Fluff the rice, scraping up the crust from the bottom of the pot.

3. Scoop out and serve by the bowlful, or eat it straight out of the rice cooker.
