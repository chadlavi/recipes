# Pressure cooker cabbage with pork

This works best with the bones and some meat from a leftover [roasted pork shoulder](./roasted-pork-shoulder).

## Ingredients

* 1 head cabbage
* 2 cups chicken stock
* Salt, pepper, and caraway seeds

## Directions (ish)

1. Quarter and core the head of cabbage, then slice into ~1cm ribbons
2. Put pork bones in the pressure cooker, then layer in cabbage -- it may be a tight fit
3. Pour ~2 cups of stock evenly over the cabbage, then add as much leftover pork as will fit on top -- probably  about a handful
4. Add salt, pepper and caraway seeds
5. Seal the pressure cooker and cook 10 minutes, then quick release
6. Remove bones and ladle cabbage and pork mixture into bowls
