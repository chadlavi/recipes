# Taiwanese braised pork rice (滷肉飯)

Few things are more representative of Taiwanese food than a steaming bowl of 滷肉飯 _(lu rou fan)_, or braised pork rice. _Lu rou fan_ has three key components: tender pork belly, a rich, sweet and savory sauce, and a bowl of fluffy white rice. Don't let the cook time scare you - most of it is for simmering the dish while you sit back and take in that delicious smell!

## Ingredients

- 8 dried shiitake mushrooms
- 1 lb pork belly, diced
- 1 tsp white sugar
- 2 tbsp Shaoxing cooking wine
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
- 1/4 c fried shallot
- 2 star anise pods
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 cloves garlic

## Directions

1. Rehydrate dried shiitake mushrooms before cooking: soak mushrooms in a bowl of hot water for 15-20 minutes until soft. Dice before using.
2. Stir-fry pork belly over medium heat until browned. Add sugar and cook until sugar is dissolved and caramelized.
3. Add shaoxing cooking wine, dark and light soy sauce, shiitake mushrooms, fried shallots, star anise, cinnamon, and garlic. Quickly toss to mix.
4. Add just enough water to cover all the ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer the dish for about 1 hour until the liquid is reduced and pork is tender.
5. Serve over rice with your choice of vegetables!
