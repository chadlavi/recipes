# Instant Pot Lamb Ragu

## Ingredients

* 1.125 lb lamb, cut into about 2" (5cm) square pieces
* 1 Small red onion peeled and finely chopped
* 1 Carrot peeled and finely chopped
* 1 Celery stalk finely chopped
* 4 cloves Garlic peeled and finely chopped
* 2 tbs Fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped or 2 tsp dried
* 2 tbs Fresh rosemary, finely chopped or 2 tsp dried
* 2 14 oz cans of San Marzano whole plum tomatoes or other whole canned tomato of choice
* 10 oz good quality red wine
* 7 tbs butter
* 1 lb fresh pappardelle pasta
* 1/2 cup finely graded Parmesan or Grana Padano cheese

## Directions

1. Begin by heating the olive oil in the bowl of the instant pot. Once heated (oil should be shimmering), add the meat and brown on all sides. You may have to do this in two batches.
2. Once the meat is browned, remove it to a plate; add onions, carrots, celery and herbs to instant pot bowl. Stir and continue cooking until the veggies are softened (takes about 7-10 minutes). Add garlic and stir for a minute or two until the garlic is just fragrantâ€”don't overcook it.
3. Deglaze the bottom of the instant pot bowl with the wine. Scrape up any and all stuck bits.
4. Cook the wine down until it is mostly evaporated.
5. Carefully add your plum tomatoes and stir slowly and softly so as not to break them up.
6. Add the meat back in.
7. Cook on high pressure for 50 minutes.
8. Check your seasonings and adjust with salt and pepper as required.
9. Place cooked meat in a bowl and cool slightly, then pull the meat apart with forks.
10. While the meat cools, you may need to continue cooking the ragout to reduce the sauce to the consistency you wish.
11. Stir your pulled meat back into your perfect sauce. Taste! Adjust seasonings if needed.
12. Add the butter and stir until the ragout is fully mixed and shiny.
13. Then throw in the cheese stir and remove from the heat.
14. Drain your pasta (saving a cup of liquid) and slide it into the ragout, tossing the pasta with the sauce until mixed (add pasta water if needed).
15. Finally, garnish with a little finely chopped fresh rosemary and Parmesan.
