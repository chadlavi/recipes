# Soy glazed salmon hand rolls

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons neutral oil, such as safflower or canola
- 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/3 cup mirin
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more for seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon peeled grated ginger
- 1(1½-pound) skinless salmon fillet (preferably center-cut)
- Toasted seaweed sheets, quartered
- Cooked short-grain rice and wasabi paste (optional), for serving
- 3 Persian cucumbers, halved crosswise and cut lengthwise into thin spears
- 1 to 2 avocados, pitted and thinly sliced

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a small saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium. Stir in garlic until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add soy sauce, mirin, sugar, black pepper and ¼ teaspoon salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced by about a third and has thickened slightly, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in ginger and remove from heat. You should have about ½ cup sauce; reserve half of the sauce in a small bowl for serving and set aside.
2. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place salmon on the prepared sheet, rub with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt. Coat the salmon on both sides with the other half of the sauce.
3. Roast salmon for 5 minutes, then baste with the sauce that’s dripped onto the sheet tray. Continue to roast until salmon is just cooked to medium, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer salmon to a large plate.
4. Flake salmon into bite-size pieces and drizzle with the reserved sauce. To build hand rolls, top seaweed with some rice (if using), cucumbers, avocado and salmon. Wrap and enjoy. Serve with optional wasabi on the side, and dab a little onto the salmon for a spicy hit.
