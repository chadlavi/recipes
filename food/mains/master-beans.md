# Master Beans

Makes5 cups

## Ingredients

PRODUCE

- 1 red, yellow, or white onion, or
- 2 large shallots
- 1 whole garlic head
- 1 fresh chile, such as jalapeño, Fresno, or serrano
- 3 large basil, parsley, or cilantro sprigs or fresh bay leaves

DAIRY

- 1 Parmesan cheese rind (optional)

MEAT

- 2 slices pork product (about 1 ounce), such as bacon, mortadella, ham, or prosciutto (optional)

PANTRY

- 1 pound dried beans
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt

## Directions

1. Soak the beans: Place 1 pound dried beans in a large bowl and cover them with 6 cups cold water. Let them soak at room temperature for at least 6 hours and up to 18.[^1]
2. Preheat the oven to 300°F.
3. Build the cooking liquid:
    - Drain the beans in a fine-mesh strainer. Add them to a large Dutch oven along with 6 cups cold water and 3/4 teaspoon baking soda.
    - Cut 1 onion into quarters through the root end.
    - Cut 1 whole garlic head in half crosswise.
    - Cut 1 fresh chile in half lengthwise. Add the onion, garlic, chile, and 3 large basil sprigs to the beans.
    - If you have a slice or two of bacon or any other cured pork product on hand and are looking for full-flavored, meaty beans, add that as well. And if you’re super lucky and happen to have a Parmesan rind in the fridge—don’t miss out on the opportunity to use it here; it imparts a uniquely savory flavor to the beans without reading cheesy.
4. Cook the beans:
   - Add 1 cup olive oil and 5 teaspoons salt to the water. Bring the beans to a bare simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
   - Transfer to the oven, uncovered, and cook, stirring gently once or twice, until cooked through and tender but not falling apart, 35 to 75 minutes, depending on what type of bean you’re using. The tiny ones will cook much faster, so start tasting early if you’re using a smallish bean, and always taste more than one to be certain they’re done.
5. Pluck out and discard any large pieces of onion, garlic, chile, bacon, herbs, and the cheese rind. Taste and add more salt if you think they need it. You can eat these straight out of the pot or use them in any of the recipes in the book that call for beans. They’re great hot in their broth, amazing cold when marinated in some oil, vinegar, and herbs, and really just one of life’s greatest pleasures to have on hand.

## Reference

- _Cook This Book_, Molly Baz (p.160)

[^1]: The beans need a jump start on absorbing some of the water so that they cook evenly once they’re on the stove. If you don’t have time to soak them, place the dried beans in a pot and cover them with water. Bring them to a boil, turn off the heat, and let them sit for 10 minutes before draining them. Proceed with the rest of this recipe.
