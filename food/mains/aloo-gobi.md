## Ingredients

- 2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (12 ounces; 350g), peeled, quartered, and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
- 2 tablespoons (18g) plus 1 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) distilled white vinegar
- 2 quarts (1.9L) vegetable oil, for frying
- 1 medium head cauliflower (1 pound; 450g), trimmed and cut into 2-inch florets
- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
- 1 small yellow onion (4 ounces; 110g), diced
- One 2-inch knob fresh ginger (1/3 ounce; 10g), peeled and cut into matchsticks
- 2 medium garlic cloves, minced
- 2 hot green chiles, sliced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons turmeric
- 2 teaspoons kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crushed lightly (see note)
- 2 plum tomatoes (7 ounces; 200g), cored and diced
- 10 to 12 sprigs cilantro including stems, cut into 1-inch pieces

## Directions

1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. In a 3-quart saucepan, combine potatoes, 2 tablespoons salt, vinegar, and 2 quarts cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until potatoes are tender and offer little resistance when pierced with a paring knife, about 11 minutes. Drain potatoes, transfer to prepared baking sheet, and let cool for at least 20 minutes.
2. Line a separate rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. In a large Dutch oven or wok, heat oil over high heat to 375째F (190째C). Add half of the cauliflower florets and cook, stirring gently with a spider or tongs, until florets are lightly browned and fully tender, about 2 minutes. Transfer florets to prepared baking sheet and season lightly with salt. Return oil to return to 375째F and repeat with remaining florets.
3. Return oil to 375째F. Add potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and crisp on the outside, about 2 minutes. Transfer potatoes to baking sheet with cauliflower and set aside. Carefully transfer oil to a large heatproof bowl.
4. Return 3 tablespoons oil to now-empty Dutch oven or wok and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add cumin seeds and cook until seeds start to spit, about 10 seconds. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until onions just start to brown, about 8 minutes. Add ginger, garlic, and chiles and cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Mound vegetables in center of pan, add turmeric and dried fenugreek leaves on top, and stir to combine. Stir in chopped tomatoes and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and cook until tomatoes break down slightly and release their liquid, about 2 minutes.
5. Stir in 1 cup water, increase heat to high heat, and cook until liquid reduces slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add reserved cauliflower and potatoes and fold gently to evenly coat vegetables with sauce. Off-heat, stir in cilantro. Serve immediately.
