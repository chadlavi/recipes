# Hungarian Goulash

2 LB chuck beef diced
2 cups carrots
2 tablespoons paprika
1 Yellow onion
1 can diced tomatos
1 tsp caraway seeds
1/2 cup dry red win (pinot noir or saivagnon)
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1/2 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
(Optional) pasta or egg noodles
Cornstarch slurry

Slice onion into long strips and dice beef into bite sized cubes
Melt 2 tablespoons butter into pot
Add onions stirring until coated saute for 3 minutes
Add caraway seeds and paprika and 2 more tablespoons butter stir until onions are coated
Add beef allow to sear while constantly stirring
Add beef broth and wine (if not using wine add 2 cups broth(
Add ketchup
Add brown sugar, salt and pepper
Stir and add carrots
Cook for 30 minutes
Slowly add cornstarch slurry.

note: During the onion saute stage i personally like to render the fat trimmed from the beef in place of the butter.
Note 2: i did use an instant pot to cook the goulash, however this wont affect cooking time if youre using a regular pot and stove
