# Portuguese Baked Eggs

## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 3 bell peppers, any color, thinly sliced
* 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
* 2 beefsteak tomatoes, cut into wedges
* 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1 jalapeño, with seeds, halved lengthwise
* 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves
* 2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves
* 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 cup ricotta
* 6 large eggs
* 1 cup grated sharp white cheddar (about 4 oz.)
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan (about 1 oz.)
* Toasted country-style bread (for serving)

## Directions
1. Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add bell peppers and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just beginning to brown, 10–12 minutes.
2. Add tomatoes, garlic, jalapeño, basil, oregano, chili powder, and paprika to pot. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft and liquid is thickened, 20–30 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Discard jalapeño.
3. Preheat oven to 400°. Transfer bell pepper mixture to a 13x9” baking dish. Using the back of a spoon, make 6 evenly spaced divots in mixture. Spoon a dollop of ricotta into each divot, then crack 1 egg into each. Top with cheddar and Parmesan; season with salt and pepper. Bake, rotating dish halfway through, until Parmesan is melted and egg whites are almost set but yolks are still runny, 15–18 minutes.
4. Serve baked eggs with toast. (Yolks will continue to cook as dish sits, so serve right away if you prefer your eggs soft.)
