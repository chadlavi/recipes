# Pressure cooker Korean braised oxtail (kkorijjim)

## Ingredients

* 3 to 4 pounds oxtail or beef short ribs
* 1/2 medium onion, cut into large chunks
* 1 to 2 carrots, cut into large chunks
* 3 to 4 dried shiitake mushrooms, briefly soaked and quartered (omit if unavailable)

Braising liquid

* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup rice wine (or mirin or dry white wine)
* 1/2 medium Korean/Asian pear (or 1 bosc pear or apple), grated
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic
* 1 inch ginger, grated (about 1 teaspoon)
* 3 tablespoons honey (or sugar)
* 3 tablespoons maesil cheong (or 1 more tablespoon honey or sugar)
* pepper to taste
* Other additions and garnishes
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 2 scallions, roughly chopped (and some finely sliced for optional garnish)
* sesame seeds - optional

## Directions

1. Trim off excess fat. Rinse the oxtail pieces and let them sit in cold water for 10 to 20 minutes to draw out excess blood. Drain well, and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Press the "Saute" button on the Instant Pot. When the pot is hot, add 1 tablespoon of canola or vegetable oil. Sear the oxtail pieces in two batches, browning all sides. You can sear the meat in a separate pan or skip this step if you want.
3. Mix together the braising liquid ingredients. Place the oxtail pieces in one layer in the pot, and pour the braising liquid over.
4. Add the vegetables.
5. Close the lid tightly. Press the "Meat" function, and using the "+" button, increase the time to 45 minutes. When finished, the Instant Pot will automatically turn to the "Keep Warm" mode. Leave the pressure cooker alone for about 10 minutes before opening the lid.
6. Stir in the scallion and the sesame oil. Remove the meat and vegetables from the pressure cooker. Strain the cooking liquid into a bowl to skim off the fat. I use a fat separator. Pour the sauce over the ribs to serve. You can also cool it in the fridge or freezer until the fat solidifies to spoon off, and then reheat the sauce. Garnish with the optional scallions and sesame seeds.
