# Roger Ebert's Fragrant Rice with Chicken

## Ingredients

* 1 cube chicken bouillon
* 1 1/2 cups warm water
* 1 1/2 cups jasmine or basmati rice
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 2 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 green onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, chopped
* 1 2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced
* 2 boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
* 2 to 3 cups cut vegetables such as bell pepper, broccoli, carrots, etc.

## Directions

1. Dissolve the bouillon cube in the water and combine rice in the rice cooker with the oils, salt, garlic, and ginger. Stir well, then place the chicken and vegetables on top. Turn on the rice cooker and allow it to cook until finished. (This recipe could also be prepared in a medium saucepan with a lid: proceed by bringing to a boil and simmering over low heat until the rice is cooked.)
2. Once ready, stir the ingredients well to coat the rice with oil and serve with Sriracha or other hot sauce, if desired.
