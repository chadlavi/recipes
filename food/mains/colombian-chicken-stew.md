Don't forget to properly salt this! Also a good idea to toss in some garlic.

## Ingredients

- 4 large Russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1- to 2-inch chunks
- 1 large onion, sliced into 1/4-inch slices (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 4 medium beefsteak tomatoes, cut into 1- to 2-inch chunks (about 3 cups)
- 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 2 bay leaves
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Combine potatoes, onion, tomato, chicken pieces, bay leaves, and a large pinch of salt in a pressure cooker. Toss with hands to combine. Seal lid and cook under high pressure for 30 minutes. Release pressure, remove lid, season to taste, and serve.
