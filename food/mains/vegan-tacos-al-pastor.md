# Vegan Tacos Al Pastor

## Ingredients

For the filling:

* 3 (5-6″) dried guajillo chiles (stems and seeds removed)
* 1 cup pineapple juice
* juice of 2 limes
* 3 cloves of garlic, smashed and peeled
* 1/2 of a white onion, roughly chopped (the rest will be for topping the tacos)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon dried (Mexican) oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1.75 ounces achiote paste (half of the 3.5 package)
* 4 1/2 cups medium-sized (size of a quarter) chunks of TVP, rehydrated
* 2/3 cup fresh pineapple, diced

Garnish:

* the rest of that white onion, minced
* minced cilantro
* lime
* salt
* tortillas

## Directions

1. In a dry medium saucepan toast the guajillos on both sides for 3-5 minutes. Once they’re toasted cover them with water, bring to a boil, and then bring down to a simmer for about 15 minutes, until the peppers are soft.
2. If you haven’t already, make sure to squeeze out any excess water out of your tvp, so it can absorb the marinade.
3. Add softened peppers to the blender and mix in the pineapple juice, lime juice, cloves of garlic, 1/2 white onion, salt, Mexican oregano, cinnamon, and achiote paste. Blend until smooth.
4. Place your TVP in a gallon size plastic bag, add in the diced pineapple and pour in the marinade. Marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
5. Once your TVP is done marinating, and you're ready to cook, drain the excess marinade.
6. Preheat two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet and add the TVP/pineapple and fry, stirring occasionally until the TVP is hot and slightly crispy on the outside.

Serve on a warm tortilla and garnish with your favorite taco fixings.
