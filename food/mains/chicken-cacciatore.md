# Chicken cacciatore

4-6 servings

## Ingredients

- 3 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken legs with thighs and drumsticks split (or same quantity of just skin-on, bone-in thighs)
- 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 large red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and thinly sliced
- 5 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 3/4 cup dry white wine
- 1 (28oz) can peeled whole tomatoes, drained and crushed by hand, plus 1/2 cup reserved juices from can
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, sage, or thyme
- 1 bay leaf

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Season chicken all over with salt and pepper.
2. In a Dutch oven or large straight-sided sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter as it finishes cooking and set aside.
3. Add onion, pepper, and garlic and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until softened, about 8 minutes.
4. Add wine and bring to a simmer. Add tomatoes and reserved juices, along with herb sprigs and bay leaf. Return to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Nestle chicken and any accumulated juices into liquid and vegetables.
5. Transfer to oven and cook, uncovered, until chicken is fully cooked through and tender and sauce is slightly reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes. Discard herb sprigs and bay leaf. Serve right away, garnishing with minced parsley if desired.
