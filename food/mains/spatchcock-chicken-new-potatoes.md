# Spatchcock Chicken over New Potatoes

## Ingredients
* one whole, air-chilled chicken (without gizzards)
* 2 lb new potatoes
* olive oil
* herbes de province
* sea salt and black pepper

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425ºF with a rack in the center.
2. Rinse and dry the new potatoes.
3. Put the potatoes in a 4qt pyrex baking dish, drizzle with oil, sprinkle with sea salt, herbes de province, and black pepper.
4. Spatchcock the chicken: Use kitchen shears to cut the spine out, then lay the chicken flat, skin-side-up, on top of the potatoes. Place the removed spine strip skin-side-up at one side of the pyrex dish as well.
5. Use a paper towel to pat the chicken skin dry, then sprinkle with sea salt and pepper.
6. When the oven is preheated, put the dish on the center rack. Cook the chicken and potatoes at 425ºF for 90-120 minutes.
7. Remove the chicken from the oven. The skin will be very crisp; remove it immediately (use tongs—there's steam!) so it doesn't get soggy. You've earned this part: eat that skin. Yes, all of it.
8. Let the chicken cool until you can handle it (10-15 minutes), then remove the meat from the carcass; it should be quite easy to remove. Save the carcass for stock. Stir the new potatoes in the rendered chicken fat to coat evenly. Serve immediately.
