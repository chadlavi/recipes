# 牛丼 (gyūdon)

## Ingredients

* 1 onion
* 2 green onions/scallions
* 3/4 lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or rib eye) (12 oz or 340 g)
* 1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
* 3 large eggs (beaten, optional)
* 2 tsp sugar
* 2 Tbsp sake
* 2 Tbsp mirin
* 1 Tbsp soy sauce

## Directions

1. Cook a batch of rice by whatever means you usually would.
2. Slice the onions, cut the green onion into thin slices (save for garnish),
   and cut the meat into small pieces.
3. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium high heat and cook the onions
   until tender.
4. Add the meat and sugar and cook until no longer pink.
5. Add sake, mirin, and soy sauce.
6. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes.
7. If you like to add the egg, slowly and evenly drizzle the beaten egg over the
   beef. Cook covered until the egg is done. Add the green onion right before
   removing from the heat.
8. Place the beef and egg on top of steamed rice, pour the desired amount of
   cooking sauce, and top with green onion and pickled red ginger.
