* 1 tbsp Ghee or Oil
* 1 Green Chili Pepper chopped (optional)

* 1 tsp Cumin seeds (Jeera)
* 2 leaves Bay leaf (Tej Patta)
* 1/2 tsp Black Peppercorns
* 1 stick Cinnamon (Dalchini)

### Ingredient substitutions
*  If you don't have dry mango powder or amchur, replace with 1 tablespoon lemon
   juice.
*  If you don't have chole masala, you can also replace it with a blend of:
   * 2 black cardamom
   * 5 cloves
   * 1/2 inch Cinnamon stick
   * 1 tsp Coriander powder
   * 1/4 tsp Turmeric powder
   * 1/2 tsp Cayenne or Red Chili powder
* To use canned chickpeas: Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Pressure cook for 10
  minutes in the instant pot or 2 whistles on the stovetop pressure cooker. Add
  only 1 cup water for cooking.
* To use canned tomatoes: Use one cup canned tomatoes to replace fresh tomatoes. 

## Directions
1. Wash and soak chickpeas in 3 cups of water overnight or at least for 4+
   hours. 
2. Start instant pot in sauté mode. Add oil, whole spices (cumin seeds, bay
   leaves, black peppercorn, cinnamon), ginger, garlic and green chili. 
3. When the ginger and garlic turn golden brown, add onions and sauté for 3
   minutes 
4. Add tomato and all spices except dry mango powder. Drain the chickpeas
   soaking water. Add chickpeas and water for cooking. Stir well.
5. Change the instant pot setting to bean/chili mode for 35 minutes with vent in
   sealing position. (This is the same as pressure cook on high pressure for 35
   minutes)
6. When the instant pot beeps, let the pressure release naturally. If the pin
   does not drop in 20 minutes, you can release the pressure and open the
   instant pot.
7. If you like a thicker gravy, use a hand masher or the back of your ladle to
   mash the chole a bit. Add the dried fenugreek leaves and dry mango powder.
   Change the instant pot setting to sauté mode and let it boil for 2 minutes.
8. Garnish with cilantro. Chole Masala is ready to be served with naan or
   bhatura.
