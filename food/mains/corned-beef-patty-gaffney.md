# Corned beef à la Patty Gaffney

* Sear corned beef in skillet
* Deglaze pan with coca cola
* Corned beef in crock pot on top of a reasonable amount of quartered onion, large it carrots, bay leaves, small amount cabbage, 5-7 cloves of garlic unpeeled but crushed slightly, sone celery if you have it, two small chopped potatoes. Top with pepper, a good pinch of cloves, and any spices that come with the beef, pour deglazed liquid and the rest of the can of coke in, then water to cover. DO NOT SALT further. It's already salted!

* Remove meat to board, wrap in foil, cook at 250° for 30min or so to dry to reasonable moisture.
* Cut against grain. Falls apart.
