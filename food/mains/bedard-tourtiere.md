# Bedard family Tourtière

## Original Recipe
This original recipe from my grandfather's family store, Midway Market (or just "Bedard's) in Plainfield, CT makes 15 (*fifteen!*) pies. There are no instructions.

### Ingredients
* 6 lbs ground hamburger
* 4 lbs pork
* 5 lbs potatoes
* 2 lbs crackers
* 1 lb onions
* 2 oz salt
* 4 tsp pepper
* 2 tsp cloves
* 3 tsp celery salt
* 4 tsp poultry seasoning
* 6 qts water

## My Adapted Recipe - Version 1
This is my first attempt to adapt the recipe for a single homemade pie. To maintain reproducible conditions, I'm using storebought crust while I experiment with the filling.

I cut each ingredient 15x, which yields some odd results, so I rounded them to the nearest conventional equivalent. The original recipe called for 2lb of crackers, so I wanted to be sure I added them by weight; but 2lb / 15 = 2.134oz, which is difficult to measure with a scale that only gives one decimal place of accuracy for ounces. I ended up going metric for this one, because 2.134oz ≅ 60g, or 4g more than if I had rounded to just 2oz. Likewise, for salt, accurately measuring 1/15th of 2oz seemed a bit too difficult (0.134oz), but converting to metric gave me 3.78g, and I rounded to 4g.

I was somewhat at a loss for what to do, so I sort of just winged it. For example, I decided to add an egg wash to the crust.

### Ingredients
Filling:
* 6 oz 75% lean ground hamburger
* 4 oz ground pork
* 5 oz potato
* 60 g ground oyster crackers
* 1 oz onions
* 4 g salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/8 tsp ground clove
* heaping 1/4 tsp celery salt
* 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning
* 1.5 cups water

Egg wash:
* 1 large egg
* 1 tsp water

### Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF.  
2. Finely dice the potato and onion.  
3. Run the crackers through a food processor or blender.  
4. Combine the pork, beef, onion, potato, cracker, spices, and water in a large bowl, then add the water and use your hands to emulsify it all.
5. Grease an earthenware pie dish with butter, and leave it in the refrerator until needed.
6. If using storebought dough, allow it to come to room temperature for up to 15min.
7. When the oven is preheated, take your pie dish out of the refrigerator and line it with one of the doughs. Pour in the meat filling,and use the back of a spoon to smooth and level the top.
8. Cut a small circle out of the other pie crust, then place it on top of the meat filling. Form it carefully to the edges of the bottom crust, then roll the excess of both tightly down to where they meet. Use the tines of a small fork to crimp the crust edge down.
9. For the egg wash, beat the large egg and water together with a fork until strands of egg protein can't be lifted out of it with the fork anymore. Use a pastry brush to apply a very thin, even layer to the entire top crust. 
10. Wrap the edges of the crust in tin foil, then bake for 25 minutes with the crust covered.
11. Remove the tin foil guards and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, for a 45-50 minute total bake. The top should be golden brown,and juices should be bubbling out of the vent.
