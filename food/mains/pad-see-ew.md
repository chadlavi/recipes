# Pad See Ew

The key to a good pad see ew is cooking ingredients quickly over high heat, so it is very important not to crowd the pan.

## Ingredients

- 8 oz thinly sliced beef or chicken
- 1 tsp and 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- 3 tbsp and 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 c Chinese broccoli
- 11 oz fresh wide rice noodles
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 2 tsp Thai soy sauce
- 1 egg

## Directions

1. Marinate the meat in 1 tsp dark soy sauce, 1 tsp vegetable oil, and cornstarch. Set aside.
2. Make the stir-fry sauce by combining oyster sauce, Thai soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and fish sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
3. Heat your pan over high heat and cook meat until almost cooked through, then remove meat from the pan.
4. Add garlic and Chinese broccoli to the same pan and stir-fry until broccoli begins to wilt.
5. Make sure your rice noodles are at room temperature before cooking! If they are cold from refrigeration, rinse them under hot water to soften. Add in rice noodles and stir-fry sauce and stir together. Add the meat back in and combine.
6. Push everything to one side of your pan and add in a beaten egg on the other side to scramble. Stir everything together and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Serve and enjoy!
