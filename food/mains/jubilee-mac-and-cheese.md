# Baked Macaroni and Cheese (from _Jubilee_)

## Ingredients

- Softened butter, for the baking dish
- 1 pound elbow macaroni
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 cups shredded Jack cheese
- Paprika

### Cream sauce

- 1 stick (4 ounces) butter, melted
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 3 large eggs, well beaten
- 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter a 13 × 9-inch baking dish.
2. Bring a large pasta pot or saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente. Drain.
3. In a large bowl, combine the Cheddar and Jack cheeses. Measure out 1 cup of the cheese mixture and set aside for the top of the dish. Layer the remaining combined cheeses and macaroni in the buttered baking dish, beginning and ending with the macaroni.
4. Make the cream sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sour cream, eggs, evaporated milk, 1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste), white pepper, and cayenne.
5. Pour the cream sauce over the macaroni and cheese. Top with the reserved I cup cheese and sprinkle generously with paprika. Place the dish on a rimmed baking pan to catch any juices that spill over.
6. Bake until the cheese is bubbling and the top is browned and crusty, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand 10 minutes before serving.
