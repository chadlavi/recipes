# Kuku Sabzi (Persian Herb Frittata)

## INGREDIENTS

6 large eggs, beaten
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 teaspoon salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 cup chopped chives or green onions
1 cup chopped cilantro
1 cup chopped dill
1 cup chopped parsley
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts (optional)
2 tablespoons dried barberries, currants, or cranberries (optional)
2 tablespoons clarified butter/ghee, butter, or vegetable oil
Plain yogurt, to serve (optional)

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400Â°F.

Whisk together the eggs, garlic, flour, turmeric, salt, and a few cracks of black pepper. Whisk in the herbs, walnuts (if using), and dried fruit (if using).

Heat the butter or oil in a 10-12" skillet over moderate heat. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and use the back of a spoon to spread it out evenly. Cook until the eggs start to set around the edges of the skillet, about 2 minutes.

Place the skillet in the oven and bake until the eggs are completely set, about 5 minutes. To test, cut a small slit in the center.

Serve hot or cold, cut into wedges. Especially delicious with a dollop of yogurt.
