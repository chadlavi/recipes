# Chicken adobo

## Ingredients

* 1 cup coconut milk
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1.5 cup rice vinegar
* 12 garlic cloves, peeled
* 3 whole birdâ€™s-eye chilies or other fiery chili
* 3 bay leaves
* 1.5 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
* 3 to 4 pounds chicken thighs

## Directions

1. Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a large, nonreactive bowl or
   resealable plastic freezer bag. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Refrigerate
   overnight or for at least 2 hours.
2. Place chicken and marinade in a large lidded pot or Dutch oven over high heat
   and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and tender, around 30
   minutes.
3. Heat broiler. Transfer chicken pieces to a large bowl, raise heat under the
   pot to medium-high, and reduce the sauce until it achieves almost the
   consistency of cream, about 10 minutes. Remove bay leaves and chilies.
4. Place chicken pieces on a roasting pan and place under broiler for 5 to 7
   minutes, until they begin to caramelize. Remove, turn chicken, baste with
   sauce and repeat, 3 to 5 minutes more. Return chicken to sauce and cook for a
   few minutes more, then place on a platter and drizzle heavily with sauce.
