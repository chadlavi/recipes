## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 2 cans cream of mushroom soup
- 1 small bag mixed frozen veggies of choice
- 1 pkg tater tots
- 1 large onion
- 1 cup cheddar cheese
- 1 Tbsp flour (optional)
- MSG (optional)
- diamond crystal kosher salt
- ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Put the diced onion in a skillet over medium-high heat and add kosher salt. Add the ground beef, season with pepper and saute until ground beef is cooked and onions are translucent. Optionally stir in flour and MSG and allow to thicken slightly.
3. Grease a 9x13 pan. 
4. Pour the cooked meat and onions into the 9x13 pan. Spread the veggies evenly over the top. Add the cheddar cheese. Spread the cream of mushroom soup over the veggies.
5. Place the tater tots evenly on top of the mixture in straight lines. (It’s okay if you’re lazy and don’t put them in straight lines, just make sure they’re pretty even or they won’t cook properly)
6. Bake for 1 hour. Check. If tater tots are not golden brown and the veggies are still crunchy, put in over for another 20 minutes.
