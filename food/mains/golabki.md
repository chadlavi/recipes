# Gołąbki

## Ingredients

- 1 head of white (preferred) or savoy (alternative) cabbage
- 1.5 cups uncooked rice
- 2 pounds ground or minced beef or pork
- 3 onions, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, finely minced or pressed
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- Tomato sauce (roughly 2 jars)
- 2tbp oil or butter
- Salt and pepper

## Directions

1. Half-cook the rice as directed, then set aside to cool
2. Wash the cabbage, remove outer leaves, and core it
3. Bring large pot of well-salted water to a boil
4. Parboil cabbabe until leaves are flexible (roughly 3 minutes), then set aside until cool enough to handle
5. When the cabbage is cooled, remove ~20 whole leaves from the cabbage, cutting away any thick center ribs. Chop the rest of the cabbage and spread in the bottom of a casserole dish
6. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
7. Heat butter or oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and season with salt and pepper/ Sautée until translucent, 1-2 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove onion and garlic mixture to a bowl and allow to cool.
8. When the rice and onions/garlic are cooled, mix rice, meat, eggs, onions and garlic in a large bowl until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.
9. Assemble the gołąbki: 
   1. lay out a cabbage leaf on a plate
   2. Using two large table spoons, shape a roughly 2"x1" chunk of the filling, and place at the root end of the cabbage leaf
   3. Roll the leaf over once by rolling the filling towards the tip of the leaf, then fold over the left and right edges. Continue to roll up completely.
   4. Set aside on a plate or platter
10. When all the cabbage leaves are used up, strew any remaining filling over the chopped cabbage in the casserole dish.
11. Arrange all the gołąbki on top of the chopped cabbage and filling.
12. Pour enough tomato sauce over the entire assemblage to fill the casserole to at least half the height of the assembled rolls.
13. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes
14. Check if more liquid is needed; if so, add water. Continue to cook for another 20-40 minutes.
