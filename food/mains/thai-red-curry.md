# Thai red curry

## Ingredients

* 2tbsp coconut oil
* 3lb chicken (of any cut)
* 1 leek, halved lengthwise then cut into 1/4" pieces
* 1 red bell pepper
* 5-6 dried kaffir lime leaves
* 1.5" fresh ginger, grated or finely chopped
* 4-5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 4oz Thai red curry paste (one small can)
* 2 cans full-fat coconut milk

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 375ºF with a rack positioned in the center. Season your chicken with salt and black pepper.
2. In a large (12") cast iron pan, melt your coconut oil then brown your chicken, especially if it has skin on it. Remove to a plate.
3. Add the leek, garlic, red pepper, and ginger. Sautée until translucent (around 5min) then add the curry paste. Stir to combine, then add the coconut milk and kaffir lime leaves. Stir to combine again, and bring to a simmer.
4. Add the reserved chicken, plus any juices that accumulated on the plate. Ensure that the chicken is nestled down into the sauce. If the chicken has skin on it, ensure that it is skin-side-up. Baste the exposed top portions of the chicken pieces with the sauce.
5. Move the pan to the oven and cook for 30 minutes or until the chicken is fall-apart tender (if bone-on) or has reached an internal temperature of 165ºF (if using white meat only).
6. Serve over rice.
