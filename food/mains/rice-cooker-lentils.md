# Rice cooker lentils

Note: This works best with green/brown lentils, not red lentils. Red lentils will turn to soup if prepared this way. This has only been tested on a Zojirushi rice cooker.

* 2 parts water

## Directions

1. Combine lentils and water in rice cooker
2. Set the rice cooker to "Mixed" setting and start the cooking cycle
3. When the rice cooker finishes, stir lentils and allow to sit 5-10 minutes before serving
