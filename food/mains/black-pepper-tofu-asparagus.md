# Black pepper tofu asparagus

## Ingredients
* 1 14oz package firm or extra-firm tofu, drained
* 1 Tbsp. black peppercorns
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 1.5in piece ginger, peeled
* 1 Tbsp. cornstarch
* ½ tsp. kosher salt
* 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 lb. asparagus, trimmed, cut into 1.5in pieces
* 1/3 cup soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
* Cooked white or brown rice (for serving)

## Directions
1. Wrap tofu in a clean kitchen towel and place in a shallow baking dish or on a
   rimmed baking sheet. Weigh down with a heavy object (a cast-iron skillet
   topped with a couple of heavy cans works well). Let sit at least 15 minutes
   and up to 1 hour (go the full time if you can).
2. Meanwhile, coarsely crack peppercorns in a spice mill or with a mortar and
   pestle (you can use a chef’s knife or a very heavy object, although be
   prepared for some peppercorns to fly!); set aside. Finely grate garlic and
   ginger into a small bowl; set aside.
3. Unwrap tofu and cut into 1" cubes. Transfer tofu to a medium bowl. Add
   cornstarch and salt and toss gently to coat tofu.
4. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Arrange tofu in
   skillet in a single layer and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown
   and crisp all over, 6–8 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to
   a large plate or baking sheet.
5. Reduce heat to medium and add reserved cracked pepper to skillet. Cook,
   stirring often, until very fragrant, about 2 minutes, then add asparagus and
   cook, stirring often, until bright green, about 1 minute. Add reserved garlic
   and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
6. Return tofu to pan and gently toss to combine. Increase heat to medium-high,
   add soy sauce and sugar, and cook, tossing occasionally, until sauce thickens
   slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add vinegar. Taste and add
   more salt and/or vinegar if needed.
7. To serve, divide rice among plates and top with tofu mixture.
