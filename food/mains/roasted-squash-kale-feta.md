# Roasted Squash With Crunchy Kale & Feta

## Ingredients

* 1 (about 5 to 6 ounces) squash (delicata, butternut, kabocha), ends trimmed, seeds removed and sliced into 1/2-inch-thick half moons
* 1 bunch lacinato or curly kale, leaves removed from the stems and torn into 1-inch pieces
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
* 1/4 cup tahini
* 1/4 cup water
* 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 2 lemons)
* 1/4 cup crumbled feta
* 1/2 teaspoon ground sumac, plus more for sprinkling on top (can sub Aleppo pepper)
* 1 pinch cracked black pepper
* 1/4 cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, roughly torn (optional)

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 400ÂºF with a rack positioned in the lower third of the oven.
2. On a sheet pan, coat the squash and kale with the olive oil, then season with the cumin, red pepper flakes, and salt, until everything has a glossy sheen to it. Be sure to squeeze the kale leaves with your hands as you mix. Arrange the vegetables on the sheet pan, ensuring the squash pieces have contact with the pan and arranging the kale in empty spaces. The pan will be a little crowded, but the kale leaves will quickly shrink.
3. Roast in the oven until the squash is easily pierced with a fork and the kale crispy, 25 to 30 minutes, turning the squash over and mixing around the kale halfway into the roasting time.
4. Meanwhile, in a small serving bowl, whisk the tahini with the 1/4 cup water until it becomes a smooth, spreadable hummus-like consistency. Whisk in the juice of 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons), sumac, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Loosen with more lemon or water if needed, or add more tahini to thicken. Sprinkle some sumac on top, if desired.
5. Remove the vegetables from the oven. Pour the remaining lemon juice on top, drizzle with olive oil, and top with the crumbled feta, pepper, and parsley, if using. Serve with the sumac-tahini sauce
