# Chicken Pho

Using chicken stock helps reduce the cooking time. Add extra Thai chilis or top with Sriracha for more heat.

## Ingredients

- 8 c chicken broth
- 6-8 slices ginger
- 3 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1-2 red Thai chilies, sliced (optional)
- 8 oz chicken breast
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tbsp cooking oil
- 14 oz fresh rice noodles
- 1 c bean sprouts
- 1/2 c fresh mint
- 1/2 c fresh cilantro
- 1/2 c Thai basil
- 1 lime

## Directions

1. Bring chicken broth to a boil and add in ginger slices, fish sauce, sugar, and sliced chilis (if using). Simmer for 15 minutes.
2. Slice chicken breast and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a pan and cook chicken breast over medium- high heat until cooked through.
3. Divide up the fresh rice noodles into two large bowls and pour hot broth over the noodles. The noodles will soften quickly in the hot broth.
4. Top each bowl with chicken breast, bean sprouts, fresh herbs, and a squeeze of lime.
