# Souvlaki-ish

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken

- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 12 thighs)
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced (about 2 to 3 tablespoons)
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh oregano leaves
- 1 medium garlic clove, peeled and grated
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

### For the Salad

- 2 romaine hearts, finely shredded
- 2 mini cucumbers, halved and then thinly sliced
- 1 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup finely chopped scallions (white and green parts, about 3 scallions)
- 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh dill
- 10 pepperoncini peppers, stemmed and finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons capers in brine, drained
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving Red wine vinegar, for serving 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- Flaky salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 8 ounces feta cheese (preferably in brine), crumbled

## Directions

### Marinate the chicken

In a large zip-top bag, combine the chicken, olive oil, lemon zest and juice, oregano, garlic, paprika, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and a couple cracks of pepper. Seal the bag, and use your hands to ensure the chicken is well coated in the marinade. Let the chicken marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.

### Grill the chicken

Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before you start cooking to allow it to come to room temperature. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.

Remove the chicken from the bag, allowing any excess marinade to drip off. Place the thighs on the hot grill. Cook, covered and undisturbed, until the first side gets a good sear and easily releases from the grill, 8 to 10 minutes. Flip and cook, covered, until the second side is seared and the juices run clear or until the internal temp reaches 175Â°F, 6 to 8 minutes.

Transfer the chicken to a rimmed cutting board and cover with aluminum foil; let rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.

### Make the salad

In a large bowl, combine the romaine, cucumbers, bell pepper, scallions, dill, pepperoncini, and capers. Drizzle with the olive oil, red wine vinegar, dried oregano, a pinch of flaky salt, and a couple cracks of black pepper and toss to combine. Gently fold in the feta, and then transfer the salad to a serving platter. Serve with the chicken thighs.
