# Pickled Celery

## Ingredients
* 3 celery stalks
* equal parts white wine vinegar and water
* Kosher salt
* coriander seeds
* dried chiles (optional)
* garlic salt
* whole black peppercorns

## Directions
1. Clean the celery and chop into 1cm wide sections.
2. Add chopped celery to a quart jar. Add equal parts white wine vinegar and water until there is enough liquid to cover the celery by 1-2cm (note: celery floats! you'll likely see the extra liquid below it, not above).
3. Add a generous amount of kosher salt, around 20-25g (about 1/8 cup or so). 
4. Add whatever herbs and spices you like. The basics are coriander seeds, whole peppercorns, a dried chile, and garlic salt. Could also include dill.
