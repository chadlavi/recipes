# Chicken lentil soup with jammy onions
Really, this is a dal.

## Ingredients
* 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs, patted dry
* Kosher salt
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 large onion, thinly sliced
* 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 1 cup red lentils, rinsed
* 1 tsp. ground turmeric
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley
* 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
* Plain yogurt (for serving)

## Directions
1. Lightly season chicken thighs all over with salt and set aside.
2. Heat oil in a medium pot over medium-high. Add onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 12–15 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring often, until garlic is golden and onion is deep golden brown and lightly charred around the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat and transfer onion and garlic to a plate with a slotted spoon; set aside for serving.
3. Return pot to medium-high heat; pour in lentils and sprinkle turmeric over. Cook, stirring a few times, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add reserved chicken and 6 cups water; season generously with salt and some pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and lentils are tender, 20–25 minutes.
4. Using tongs, transfer chicken to a cutting board; let cool slightly. Shred meat with 2 forks or your hands; discard skin and bones. Return shredded chicken meat to pot and add parsley. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.
5. Ladle soup into bowls; drizzle with yogurt and top with reserved onion mixture, dividing evenly.
