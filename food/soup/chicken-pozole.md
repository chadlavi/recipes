# Chicken Pozole

## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large white onion, diced
- 1 jalapeno pepper, chopped (remove seeds for less heat)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 6-ounce cans whole green chiles, drained
- 1 cup fresh cilantro
- 4 cups low-fat, low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 15-ounce cans hominy, drained
- Sliced avocado and radishes and/or baked corn chips, for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Season the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon thyme, and salt and pepper to taste; set aside.
2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, jalapeno and garlic and cook until soft, about 4 minutes.
3. Transfer to a blender, then add the chiles, cilantro and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon thyme and puree until smooth. Return to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the sauce thickens and turns deep green, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the broth, hominy and chicken to the saucepan. Cover and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 10 minutes. Garnish with avocado, radishes and/or corn chips, if desired.
