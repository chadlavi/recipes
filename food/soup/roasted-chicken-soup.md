# Roasted chicken soup

A chicken soup that takes the whole bird straight from roasting to simmering

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken (keep the neck if included)
* 8+ garlic cloves, peeled
* 8-12 scallions, chopped into 1/4" pieces
* between 1/2 cup and 1 cup black rice, brown rice, or other hearty, hull-on grain
* 1Tbsp+ Miso paste
* Olive oil
* sea salt
* fresh ground black pepper
* herbes de provence

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400ÂºF
2. Stuff the chicken with garlic cloves and scallions
3. Lightly oil chicken skin, generously apply sea salt, pepper, and herbes de provence to both sides
4. Roast the chicken (breast-side-down, and include the neck beside it if available) in a 12" cast iron skillet for around 1 hour, rotating every 20 minutes
5. Allow the chicken to rest for 15-20 minutes
6. Start some water boiling in a large pot
7. Roughly break up the chicken and move it (and the neck) to the boiling water. Don't lose any of the garlic and scallions! Add more water as needed to just cover the chicken (some bones poking out of the water are ok)
8. Use some (other) boiling water (like from a kettle) and a wooden spoon to deglaze the cast iron skillet, and pour all those delicious fond juices into the soup pot
9. When the whole thing is back at a boil, cover completely and reduce to a simmer for 1 hour
10. Pull out the chicken and remove the bones and other unpleasant to eat parts. Return meat, shredded roughly, to pot. Smush any garlic cloves that are still intact so that they melt into the broth.
11. Stir in miso paste and return to a boil
12. Add your grain of choice
13. Follow the grain's cooking directions to cook the soup until the grains are tender
