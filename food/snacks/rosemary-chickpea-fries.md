# Rosemary Chickpea Fries

## Ingredients

* Oil for greasing the pan
* 1 cup chickpea flour
* 2 cups vegetable or chicken stock
* 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
* Salt and black pepper
* Canola or light olive oil for deep-frying

## Directions

1. Grease an 8- or 9-inch square pan. Put the chickpea flour, stock, and rosemary in a medium saucepan; season with salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture is very thick, 7 to 10 minutes. Spread the chickpea flour mixture as evenly as possible into the greased pan, cover with foil or plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour.
2. Put at least 2 inches of the canola or light olive oil in a large, deep pot over medium-high heat. Cut the chickpea flour cake into 1/2-by-3-inch strips. Add one of the strips to the oil to test whether itâ€™s hot enough; the oil should immediately bubble vigorously. Working in batches, cook the remaining strips until deep golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the strips to paper towels to drain, season with salt, and serve hot.
