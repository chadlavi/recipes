# Boneless buffalo bites

## Ingredients

- 1lb ground chicken or turkey
- 2 eggs
- 1.5 cups panko bread crumbs
- 2tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup Texas Pete or other cayenne hot sauce

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs.
2. Add ground meat and panko. Generously season with salt and pepper and mix to combine.
3. Heat 1/8" oil in a cast iron skillet over medium/medium low heat.
4. Working in batches, make bite-sized balls of the meat mixture (slightly flattened works best) and add them to the oil. Cook until deep brown on all sides and a sacrificial test bite is no longer pink in the center.
5. Remove bites to a paper towel lined plate and dispose of cooking oil. Wipe out the pan and return it go the medium low heat.
6. Add butter to the pan. When it's almost melted, turn off the heat and add the hot sauce. Whisk together until completely emulsified. 
7. Add the bites back to the pan and use a silicone spatula to mix the bites and coat throughly with the sauce. Serve immediately.
