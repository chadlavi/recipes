# Sourdough crackers

## Ingredients

- 1 cup King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour or White Whole Wheat Flour
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 cup sourdough starter, unfed/discard
- 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 2 tablespoons dried herbs of your choice, optional
- oil for brushing
- coarse salt (such as kosher or sea salt) for sprinkling on top

## Directions

1. Mix together the flour, salt, sourdough starter, butter, and optional herbs to make a smooth(not sticky), cohesive dough.
2. Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a small rectangular slab. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to a couple of hours, until the dough is firm.
3. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
4. Very lightly flour a piece of parchment, your rolling pin, and the top of the dough.
5. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough to about 1/16" thick. The dough will have ragged, uneven edges; that's OK. Just try to make it as even as possible.
6. Transfer the dough and parchment together onto a baking sheet. Lightly brush with oil and then sprinkle the salt over the top of the crackers.
7. Cut the dough into 1 1/4" squares; a rolling pizza wheel works well here.
8. Prick each square with the tines of a fork.
9. Bake the crackers for 20 to 25 minutes, until the squares are starting to brown around the edges. Midway through, reverse the baking sheets: both top to bottom, and front to back; this will help the crackers brown evenly.
10. When fully browned, remove the crackers from the oven, and transfer them to a cooling rack. Store airtight at room temperature for up to a week; freeze for longer storage.
