# Sesame rice sourdough crackers
From Sandor Katz's _"Wild Fermentation"_, shared by Claire Altizer

## Ingredients
* 1 cup leftover cooked rice
* 1/2 cup sourdough starter
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 Tbsp sesame oil
* 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
* 1 Tbsp salt
* 4 cloves garlic, crushed and finely chopped
* 1 cup rice flour
* 3 Tbsp sesame seeds

## Directions
1. Mix leftover rice, starter, water, oils, and whole wheat flour into a thick
   batter. 
2. Ferment the batter for 8-12 hours.
3. Once the batter is active, add the salt, garlic, and rice flour
4. Knead into a cohesive dough, adding a little more flour if the dough seems
   sticky. 
5. Ferment the dough for 8-12 hours.
6. Preheat the overn to 325ÂºF. Brush a cookie sheet with oil.
7. On a floured surface, roll out out baseball-sized balls of dough one at a
   time, getting each as thin as you can roll it. Cut into individual crackers
   (small squares/rectangles) and place on the cookie sheet. Prick crackers with
   a fork to increase surface area and help crisp during baking. Brush crackers
   with oil, then sprinkle sesame seeds on the surface.
8. Bake 20-25 minutes, until dry and crispy.

## Notes

### 20200921
- this dough is way too sticky to roll out then transfer. Ended up grabbing small balls of it with a fork then flattening them with the tines. 
- need to figure out a more consistent mass-based measurement for this recipe.
