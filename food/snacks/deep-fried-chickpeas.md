# Deep Fried Chick Peas

## Ingredients
* 1 can chick peas, drained and rinsed 
    * Note: if you use dried chick peas that have been soaked in water overnight, they will turn out crispier than canned chick peas
* vegetable oil for frying
* sea salt
* chili powder (optional)

## Directions
1. Remove the skins of the chickpeas (optional).
2. Dry the chick peas by rolling them between sheets of paper towel.
3. Heat the oil to 350ºF.
4. To test the temperature of the oil, if you drop a single chickpea into the oil, the oil should sizzle immediately and the chickpea should float.
5. Remove the tester and discard it so that it doesn’t burn while you cook the rest of the chickpeas.
6. Add all of the chickpeas into the hot oil and fry for 2 to 4 minutes, depending on how crispy you want your chickpeas.
7. Remove with a slotted spoon and place onto a paper bag lined plate.
    * Note: Using brown paper bags to soak the oil from deep fried foods keeps the food crunchy whereas paper towels can make them soggy.
8. Sprinkle with pinches of salt and chili powder (if using) to taste.
9. Serve warm.

## Notes
* If you want to double the recipe, deep fry the chick peas in separate batches.
* Preheat the oven to 200 F and place the fried chick peas on a brown paper bag lined baking sheet to keep them warm until ready to serve.
