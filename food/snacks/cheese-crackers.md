# Cheese Crackers

## Ingredients

* 1 1/3  cups all-purpose flour
* 1  cup loosely packed grated Cabot Farms Vermont white Cheddar (about 3 ounces)
* 2/3  cup loosely packed grated pecorino Romano cheese (about 1 ounce)
* 1  teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2  teaspoon cayenne
* 8  tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
* 1  large egg yolk
* 1/3  cup pecans, finely chopped (about 3 tablespoons)
* 3  tablespoons untoasted white sesame seeds
* 2  tablespoons ice water

## Preparation

1. Add the flour, both cheeses, salt and cayenne to the bowl of a food
   processor, and pulse until combined.
2. Scatter the cold butter chunks on top, and pulse again to form coarse crumbs.
3. Add egg yolk, pecans and seeds, and pulse to combine thoroughly, yielding a
   coarse grainy meal.
4. Transfer mixture to a large stainless-steel bowl. Sprinkle the ice water on
   top, and knead briefly to bring the dough together, as you would a pie dough.
5. Divide the dough into thirds, and roll each into a neat, 8-inch-long cylinder
   that is about the width of a silver dollar. Wrap each log in plastic wrap,
   and twist the ends tightly in opposite directions, forming a perfect and
   compact torchon. Refrigerate until well chilled and completely firm;
   overnight is ideal.
6. Heat the oven to 375. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or
   nonstick baking mats. Unwrap the dough, discarding plastic wrap, and slice
   the logs into thin coins, each about the width of a pencil.
7. Arrange the coins in neat rows on the prepared sheets, making sure they’re
   not quite touching one another. This dough won’t expand or flatten after
   baking.
8. Bake until golden at their centers and just starting to toast at their
   edges, about 20 minutes. Check them midway through baking, and rotate sheets
   if your oven bakes unevenly.
9.  Transfer the baking sheets to wire racks to cool. Once they are fully
    cooked, transfer coins to an airtight container, where they will keep for up
    to 3 weeks. (Supposedly. I suspect no one would ever let them last that
    long, though.)
