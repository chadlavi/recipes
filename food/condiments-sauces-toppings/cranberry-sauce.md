# Cranberry sauce

The holiday classic.

## Ingredients

* 2 lb fresh cranberries
* 2 cups honey
* 1/2 cup orange juice
* 1 oz brandy (or whiskey)

## Directions

* Bring honey and orange juice to a boil.
* Add cranberries and bring to a simmer.
* Simmer for *exactly* 15 minutes, making sure all the cranberries burst. Take off the heat and stir in the brandy.
* Pour the mixture into a heat-proof container, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, ideally 24.

The cranberry sauce should be easy to invert out of the container onto a plate, but you may need to use a knife or thin silicon spatula to break the vacuum around the edge of the sauce to release it.
