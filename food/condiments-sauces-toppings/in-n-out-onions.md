# In-N-Out Animal Style Onions

## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for brushing
* 2 large onions, finely chopped
* Kosher salt

## Directions
1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions and 3/4 teaspoon salt, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and soft, about 30 minutes. (If the onions brown too quickly, reduce the heat to low.) 
2. Uncover, increase the heat to medium high and continue to cook, stirring often, until caramelized, about 8 more minutes. 
3. Add 1/2 cup water to the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. 
4. Simmer, stirring, until the water evaporates, about 2 more minutes; transfer to a bowl and set aside. 

*Do ahead: The onions can be made up to 3 days ahead; cover and refrigerate, then reheat before using.*
