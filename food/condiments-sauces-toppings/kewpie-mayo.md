# Kewpie mayo

Simple recipe for Japanese mayo

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons (30ml) rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon (20ml) malt vinegar
- 1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal Kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight
- 1/2 teaspoon MSG powder (see note)
- 1/2 teaspoon Japanese mustard powder
- 1/8 teaspoon hon-dashi powder (see note)
- 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 large egg yolks (30g)
- 1 cup (240ml) vegetable oil

## Directions

1. In the immersion blender cup or a jar that just fits the immersion blender head, use a fork to stir together rice vinegar, malt vinegar, salt, MSG, mustard powder, hon-dashi powder, and garlic powder until hon-dashi is completely dissolved.
2. Add the egg yolks. Pulse with immersion blender to combine.
3. Pour all of the oil on top of the vinegar mixture and allow to settle for 15 seconds. Place head of immersion blender at bottom of cup and turn it on high speed, allowing it to run without pulsing or moving the blender head until a thick emulsion begins to form, about 15 seconds. As mayonnaise forms, slowly tilt and lift the head of the immersion blender until all oil is emulsified.
4. Transfer mayonnaise to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
