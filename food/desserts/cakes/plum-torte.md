# Plum torte

From _The New Elegant But Easy Cookbook_, by Marian Burros and Lois Levine.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 pound unsalted butter, softened
* 3/4 cup plus 1 or 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 cup unbleached flour, sifted
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 eggs
* Pinch salt
* 24 halves pitted Italian (prune or purple) plums
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon or more, to taste

## Directions

1. Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350
   degrees.
2. Cream the butter and the 3/4 cup of sugar. Add the flour, baking powder,
   eggs, and salt and beat to mix well. Spoon the batter into an ungreased 9- or
   10-inch springform pan. Cover the top with the plums, skin sides down. Mix
   the cinnamon with the remaining 1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar and sprinkle over
   the top.
3. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the center comes
   out clean. Remove from the oven and let cool; refrigerate or freeze if
   desired.
4. To serve, let the torte return to room temperature and reheat at 300 degrees
   until warm, if desired. Serve plain or with vanilla ice cream.
