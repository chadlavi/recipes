# Blueberry Sour Cream Cake

## Ingredients
Cake:
* 175g butter
* 175g golden caster sugar
* 3 eggs
* 225g self raising flour
* 1tsp baking powder
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 142ml soured cream
* 375g blueberries

Frosting:
* 200g full-fat cream cheese
* 100g icing sugar

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC  and line an 8 or 9 inch cake tin.
2. Put the butter, sugar, eggs, flour, baking powder and vanilla extract in a bowl and beat until pale. Beat in 4 tbsp of the soured cream and then stir in half of the blueberries.
3. Pour the batter into the tin and put in the oven for about 50 minutes until firm but springy and golden brown.
4. Leave to cool while you prepare the frosting: Beat the cream cheese and icing sugar together with the remaining soured cream until smooth and creamy.
5. Spread the cream cheese frosting over the cooled cake and scatter over the remaining blueberries. The cake will keep in the fridge for a couple of days (if it lasts that long).
