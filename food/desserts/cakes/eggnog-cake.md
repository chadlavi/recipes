# Eggnog Cake

## Ingredients
* 1 package yellow cake mix 
* 1 1/2 - 2 cups eggnog 
* 1/4 cup butter, softened 
* 2 Tablespoons rum 
* 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg -- should probably use quite a bit more, like 3/8 teaspoon or more. 
* 2 eggs 
* 2 tablespoons butter 
* 4 3/4 oz sliced (the flat ones) almonds, though 2.5 oz might be more reasonable, because if you pile them up more they may cook/toast/burn. 

## Directions
1. Combine all the ingredients except 2 Tablespoons butter and almonds; beat 4 minutes on medium speed. 

2. Grease a bundt pan with 2 Tablespoons butter, press almonds on bottom and sides of pan 
pour batter on top of almonds 

3. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 35- 40 minutes or until done 

4. Cool fifteen minutes in pan and then remove. Let cake cool completely before cutting. If you can help it.
