# Tahini chocolate chip cookies

## Ingredients

- 8 ounces (227 grams) tahini (1 scant cup)
- 1 cup (200 grams) sugar
- 2/3 cup (142 grams) brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons cold water
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups (256 grams) all-purpose flour
- 12 ounces (340 grams) bittersweet chocolate chunks (about 2 cups)

## Directions

1. Heat the oven to 375° F. Line a couple sheet pans with parchment or silicone mats.
2. Combine the tahini, sugar, and brown sugar in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium for a couple minutes, scraping down with a rubber spatula once or twice. It will be crumbly, not creamy.
3. Add the eggs, water, and vanilla extract. Continue to mix on medium for another couple minutes, again scraping every so often. The mixture will look glossy and fudgy.
4. Add the salt and baking soda. Mix on low just to combine. Add the flour and mix until almost combined. Now add the chocolate chips and mix again.
5. Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared sheet pans. Fill a glass with water, dip your fingers in, then use them to flatten the cookie dough blobs—figure to a little over 1/2-inch thick. (Don’t worry if you leave the top of the cookie slightly wet!)
6. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes until the edges are turning golden brown but the centers are still tender. (If you like slightly underbaked cookies—you aren’t alone!—lean toward the shorter time. If you like crispier, keep them in the oven slightly longer.)
7. Let cool on the tray for a few minutes before using a spatula to transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat the above with the remaining dough.
