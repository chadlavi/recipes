# Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour see notes below
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter see notes below, room temperature
* 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
* 6 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with non-stick spray.
2. In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking soda and salt together.
3. In another large bowl, using an electric mixer at medium speed, beat together the butter, and sugars about 2 minutes and is smooth.
4. Add the egg and vanilla and mix on low speed until mixed in.
5. Gradually add the flour mixture and mix in until just incorporated. Do not keep mixing - do not overmix.
6. Add chocolate chips and stir with a wooden spoon, again no overmixing, just until incorporated.
7. Chill dough if dough is warm.
8. Using a small or large ice cream scoop or heaping tablespoon, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, 6 to 8 per pan, depending on size you are making.
9. Bake the cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until the bottoms and edges are lightly browned and the tops feel firm when lightly touched,
10. Small cookies bake 8-10 minutes
11. Large cookies bake 10-13 minutes.
12. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool completely.

Makes 15 - 30 cookies depending on size.

## Notes
* Butter Tips: To avoid flat cookies: Be sure your butter is room temp (not melted or even softened), and try using cold/chilled dough if dough is warm: Just put it in the refrigerator to chill before baking.
* Flour Tips: Don't over-mix cookie batter especially after the flour is added and add it gradually.
