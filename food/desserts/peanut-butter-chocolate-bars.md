# Peanut butter chocolate bars

## Ingredients

- 18 graham crackers (2 sleeves of crackers; about 2 cups of crumbs or 10 ounces)
- 1 1/2 cups confectioners’ sugar
- 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, melted
- 1 1/4 cups creamy peanut butter (I prefer Jif or Skippy brands for this)
- 1 1/2 cups bittersweet chocolate chips
- Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling
- (optional) 2 cups marshmallow creme

## Directions

1. Line an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving excess to hang over the sides.
2. Place the graham crackers in a food processor and pulse until finely ground, then add the confectioners’ sugar and a pinch of kosher salt and give it a few more pulses. Add the melted butter and 1 cup of the peanut butter. Pulse until incorporated, then pour the mixture into the baking dish and pat the crust into an even layer.
3. Melt the chocolate chips over a double boiler, stirring frequently until smooth, about 5 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter. Pour the chocolate over the crust and sprinkle with flaky sea salt, then place in the refrigerator to set for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
4. Optional marshmallow topper: Once set, lift the bars out of the baking dish using the overhanging plastic wrap. Remove the plastic and place the bars on a cutting board and cut into squares. Dollop marshmallow creme over each square. Use a kitchen torch to brown the marshmallow creme right before serving.
