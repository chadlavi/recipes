# Basque cheesecake bars

Yield: 24 bars

## Ingredients

### For the crust

- Nonstick cooking spray
- 3 cups/350 grams graham cracker crumbs (from about 24 graham crackers)
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 10 tablespoons/140 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly

### For the cheesecake layer

- 2 pounds (four 8-ounce blocks) cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1⅓ cups/270 grams granulated sugar
- 6 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1¾ cups/420 milliliters heavy cream, at room temperature
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)

## Directions

1. Make the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the long sides to create a sling.
2. In a large bowl using a rubber spatula or clean hands, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter until the crumbs are evenly saturated with the butter. Transfer to the prepared pan and press into an even layer using your hands or the bottom of a measuring cup.
    - If making your own graham cracker crumbs using whole crackers, break them into pieces, place them in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and process until they are the texture of fine sand, 40 to 60 seconds. Alternatively, place the crackers in a large zip-top bag and crush using a rolling pin or the bottom of a heavy skillet.
3. Bake the crust until it’s just starting to darken around the edges and looks dry, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool at room temperature until warm but no longer hot. Increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees.
4. While the crust is cooling, prepare the cheesecake layer: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese and sugar (or do so in a large bowl, if using a hand mixer). Mix on medium speed until fluffy and smooth, 1½ to 2 minutes. With the mixer still running, add the eggs one at a time, waiting until each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next, until the mixture is completely smooth, 1½ to 2 minutes. (Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed.) Decrease the speed to low and slowly stream in the heavy cream and blend until smooth, 1 to 1½ minutes. Turn the mixer off and add the flour, vanilla extract and salt. Mix on low just until the flour is evenly distributed, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
5. Pour the batter on top of the baked crust and smooth into an even layer. Bake until the top of the cheesecake is very dark brown, smells faintly of burnt caramel and the edges are set but the center still jiggles like Jell-O when tapped, 25 to 28 minutes. (The bars will look very puffy and cracked around the edges but will deflate once cooled.) Let the bars cool in the pan at room temperature about 2 hours (or refrigerate to enjoy cold, if desired).
6. Use the parchment paper to lift the bars out of the pan and transfer them to a cutting board. (If the edges are sticking to the side, run a butter knife around the edges to release them.) Cut the bars into a 6-by-4 grid to make 24 squares, wiping your knife with a damp paper towel between each slice. Refrigerate leftover bars in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
