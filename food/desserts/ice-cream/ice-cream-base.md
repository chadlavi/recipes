# Ice Cream base

A thick, rich custard ice cream. Vanilla can be omitted if it will clash with desired flavorings.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup half and half
- 1 vanilla bean (Mexican or Bourbon), split and scraped
- 8 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- flavoring of choice (optional)
- mixins of choice (optional)

## Directions

1. In a heavy saucepan, bring cream and half and half to a bare simmer. Stir in vanilla bean and vanilla seeds. Cover, and let steep for one hour. If using a flavoring, it can be steeped with the dairy mixture for part or all of this time. Remove vanilla bean, straining dairy mixture if necessary to remove flavoring dregs.
2. Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until well-combined and light in color. Slowly pour dairy mixture into yolk mixture, whisking well to combine. Return to saucepan and cook custard on low heat, whisking frequently, until it thickens, coating the back of a spoon but leaving a clean line when swiped with a finger.
3. Strain into an airtight container. Add salt to taste. Chill overnight, then churn the next day according to manufacturer's instructions.
4. After churning, fold any desired mixins into the ice cream. Move to an airtight container and freeze for at least 3-4 hours before serving.
