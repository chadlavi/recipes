# Pistachio Ice Cream

Based on the [Ice Cream Base](ice-cream-base) recipe

## Ingredients

- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup half and half
- 1 vanilla bean (Mexican or Bourbon), split and scraped
- 8 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
- 12-16oz shelled pistachios (recommended: honey roasted)

## Directions

1. Use a food processor or blender to process roughly half the pistachios to a fine grind. Be careful not to process into a butter.
2. In a heavy saucepan, bring cream and half and half to a bare simmer. Stir in vanilla bean, vanilla seeds and processed pistachio crumbs. Cover, and let steep for one hour. Strain out bean and pistachio dregs.
3. Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until well-combined and light in color. Slowly pour dairy mixture into yolk mixture, whisking well to combine. Return to saucepan and cook custard on low heat, whisking frequently, until it thickens, coating the back of a spoon but leaving a clean line when swiped with a finger.
4. Strain into an airtight container. Add salt to taste. Chill overnight, then churn the next day according to manufacturer's instructions.
5. While churning, roughly chop remaining pistachios
6. After churning, fold the chopped pistachios into the ice cream. Move to an airtight container and freeze for at least 3-4 hours before serving.
