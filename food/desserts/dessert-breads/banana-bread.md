# Banana bread

Serves: 10 to 12 servings
Makes: 1 loaf

## Ingredients

- 4 medium bananas (20 ounces; 565g), ripe but not fully black
- 4 ounces plain Greek yogurt (1/2 cup; 115g), preferably nonfat
- 2 large eggs, straight from the fridge
- 1/2 ounce vanilla extract (1 tablespoon; 15g)
- 10 ounces all-purpose flour (2 cups; 280g)
- 5 1/4 ounces sugar (3/4 cup; 150g), preferably toasted
- 3 ounces oat flour (3/4 cup; 85g) or whole wheat
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground or grated nutmeg
- 5 1/4 ounces coconut oil, virgin or refined (3/4 cup; 150g), creamy but firm, about 70°F (21°C)
- 6 ounces toasted pecan or other nut pieces (1 cup; 170g)

## Directions

1. Line a 10 1/2– by 5 1/2–inch loaf pan with a 9- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper, or two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans with 7- by 13-inch sheets of parchment paper. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Peel bananas (for roughly 12 ounces or 340g fruit) and mash with Greek yogurt, eggs, and vanilla in a medium bowl. If bananas are under-ripe, cover bowl with plastic and let mixture stand 30 minutes.
2. Combine flour, sugar, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and coconut oil in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low until coconut oil disappears into a mealy powder. Add banana mash and continue mixing only until the floury bits disappear. Fold in nuts with a flexible spatula, scrape into prepared pan(s), and spread into an even layer. Bake until well risen and golden brown, or to an internal temperature of around 206°F (97°C), about 70 minutes for a large loaf or 45 for small. Wrapped tightly in foil, banana bread will keep up to 3 days at room temperature or 1 week in the fridge. Serve with Banana Whipped Cream, if desired.
3. For Banana Nut Muffins: Divide batter evenly among 12 lightly greased nonstick muffin cups, adding approximately 1/2 cup (4 ounces; 120g) to each cup. Bake until domed and just beginning to brown around the edges, about 25 minutes.
