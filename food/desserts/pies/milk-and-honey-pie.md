# Milk and honey pie

The original NYT cooking recipe calls for plums, but Bleego recommends bananas

## Ingredients

For the crust:

- 6 ounces (170 grams) cornflakes (about 5 cups)
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
- 8 tablespoons (115 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled

For the filling:

- 4 large egg yolks
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) honey
- 1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar
- 5 tablespoons (40 grams) cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
- 1 cup (240 milliliters) whole milk
- 1 cup (240 milliliters) heavy cream

For serving:

- 1 cup (240 milliliters) heavy cream
- 1 pound (454 grams) any fruit
  - recommended: sliced bananas
- 1 to 2 teaspoons honey (optional)

## Directions

1. Make the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees with a rack in the middle position. Combine cornflakes, sugar and salt in a food processor and process until finely ground. (You should have about 1 1/2 cups). Add butter and pulse until the mixture looks like wet sand.
2. Transfer cornflake mixture to a standard 9-inch pie plate. Using the bottom of a flat-bottomed measuring cup, press the mixture up the sides and into the bottom of the pie plate. Bake on the middle rack until dry and deeper golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. (If the crust slumps or puffs while it bakes, gently press it back into place while still warm with the measuring cup and proceed.) Let cool completely.
3. Make the filling: Whisk the egg yolks, egg, honey, sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan. Whisk in milk and cream and place over medium-high heat. Cook, whisking continuously, until mixture thickens and starts to bubble, 4 to 7 minutes. Continue to cook, whisking continuously, for 1 minute more. Pour mixture into the cooled crust and spread in an even layer. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pudding and refrigerate until firm, at least 3 hours and up to overnight.
4. To serve: Beat cream using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Dollop cream on top of pie, top with fruit. If desired, drizzle with honey and sprinkle additional crushed cornflakes on top.
