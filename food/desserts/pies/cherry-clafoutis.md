# Cherry Clafoutis

## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp. unsalted butter, softened
* 1 1/4 cups milk
* 6 tbsp. sugar
* 2 tbsp. kirsch
* 1 tbsp. vanilla extract
* 6 eggs
* Kosher salt, to taste
* 3/4 cup flour
* 3 cups black cherries, pitted or unpitted
* Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 425°. Grease a 9″ cast-iron skillet or baking dish with butter; set aside. Combine milk, sugar, kirsch, vanilla, eggs, and salt in a blender. Blend for a few seconds to mix ingredients, then add flour and blend until smooth, about 1 minute.
2. Pour batter into buttered skillet, then distribute cherries evenly over top. Bake until a skewer inserted into batter comes out clean and a golden brown crust has formed on top and bottom of clafoutis, about 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.
