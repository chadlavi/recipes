# Slab pie

A no-fuss summer party/picnic dessert. Makes an entire large pyrex dish of pie.

## Ingredients

* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1-3/4 cup cold shortening
* 1/2 cup cold water
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon white vinegar
* FILLING:
  * 8 cups fresh or frozen blackberries
  * 2 cups sugar
  * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
  * Half-and-half cream

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt; cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a bowl, combine water, egg and vinegar; stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Form into a roll. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
2. On a floured surface, roll two-thirds of the dough into a 18x14-in. rectangle. Carefully place onto the bottom and up the sides of a 13x9-in. baking dish. Combine berries, sugar and flour; pour into crust. Use the remaining dough to make lattice strips; place over the filling. Brush pastry with cream.
