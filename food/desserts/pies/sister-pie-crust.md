# All butter crust from Sister Pie

## Ingredients
* 2.5 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold
* 1/2 cup ice cold water
* 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar

## Directions
1. Combine flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl
2. put the sticks of butter in the bowl and turn to coat
3. cut the butter into 1/4in cubes with a bench scraper, then work quickly with
   your hands to separate the cubes and coat them all
4. cut the small cubes in half again with the bench scraper and ensure all
   surfaces are coated 
5. Using a pastry blender/cutter, cut into the butter cubes then (carefully) use
   your hand to toss and turn the ingredients until the butter chunks are the
   size of small peas and the rest of the mixutre resembles parmesan cheese
6. Add the water/vinegar mixture all at once, and using the bench scraper scrape
   the mixture from one side of the bowl to the other until no more visible
   pools of liquid remain
7. using the tips of your fingers, scoop up as much of the mixture as you can
   and press it back into the rest. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat until
   you get one cohesive mass
8. remove the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into two
   equal pieces, patting each into a 2 inch thick disc then wrapping tightly in
   a double layer of plastic wrap
9. Refrigerate at least 2 hours or ideally overnight. When rolling out the
   dough, the disc should feel as hard and cold as a stick of butter straight
   from the fridge
