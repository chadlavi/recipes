# Tarte Tatin

## Ingredients

* One 14-ounce package all-butter puff pastry
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 12 Golden Delicious apples—peeled, halved lengthwise and cored
* Crème fraîche, for serving

## Directions

1. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry 1/8 inch thick. Cut out a 12-inch round, transfer to a baking sheet and refrigerate; reserve the pastry scraps for another use.
2. In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the butter. Add the sugar and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a simmer, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Arrange the apple halves standing upright in the skillet in 2 snug concentric circles. Return to the heat and cook undisturbed until an amber caramel forms, about 30 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 375°. Top the apples with the puff pastry and bake for about 40 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the apples are tender. Let cool for 15 minutes.
4. Place a large plate on top of the skillet and carefully invert the tart. Serve warm with crème fraîche.
