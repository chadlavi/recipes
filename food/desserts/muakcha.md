# Muakacha (phyllo crinkle cake)

## Ingredients

Phyllo

- 1 c unsalted butter melted
- 1 box phyllo pastry sheets

Custard

- 1 c cane sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1 c whole milk
- 1 tsp ground cardamom (optional)

Sugar syrup

- 1 c cane sugar
- 1 c water
- crushed pistachios (optional)
- cardamom pods (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F.
1. Melt the butter in the microwave or in a pan on the stove. Lightly coat the sheet pan with butter, about two tablespoons.
1. Take two pieces of phyllo dough and hold them up horizontally. Fold or scrunch the pieces from the top down in an accordion shape until you reach the end. Place the scrunched-up piece of phyllo dough onto the edge of the sheet pan that has the same width. Continue with all of the pieces of phyllo dough.
1. Place the sheet pan into the oven for 10 minutes. Remove the sheet pan and evenly pour butter over the phyllo dough.
1. Place the sheet pan back into the oven for another 10 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the custard ingredients until fully incorporated.
1. Remove the sheet pan and pour the custard evenly over the phyllo dough.
1. Place it back in the oven for 15 minutes, then turn the pan in the oven. Cook for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown.
1. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, make the simple syrup. In a pan over medium heat, combine the sugar and the water and stir. Add optional crushed pistachios and whole cardamom pods. Cook for about 8-10 minutes or until reduced by half. Remove the cardamom pods.
1. Remove the sheet pan and drizzle with the simple syrup. You have the option of adding ground pistachios on the top and serving with fresh strawberries on the side.
