# Tiramisu

I learned this recipe at a small private cooking school in the Amalfi Coast in Italy.

## Ingredients
* 6 eggs
* 500g fresh cream
* 500g mascarpone
* 6 tsp sugar
* 1 pkg lady fingers cookies
* 1-2 cups of strong coffee (best prepared with a bombona)
* cocoa powder

## Directions
1. Separate the egg yolks and whites
2. Whip the egg whites until stiff
3. Mix the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture lightens in color
4. Gently fold the mascarpone and the whipped egg whites into the yolk mixture
5. Construct the tiramisu by alternating layers of ladyfingers dipped in the coffee and layers of the prepared cream in a rectangular glass dish. You should have at least two layers.
6. Dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
