See also [tonyb's version](./dutch-baby-pancake).

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup milk, room temperature
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- pinch of nutmeg
- 3 eggs, room temperature
- 4 Tbsp butter

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Combine eggs, flour, milk, sugar and nutmeg in a blender jar and blend until smooth. Batter may also be mixed by hand.
3. Place butter in a heavy 10-inch skillet or baking dish and place in the oven. As soon as the butter has melted (watch it so it does not burn) add the batter to the pan, return pan to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the pancake is puffed and golden. Lower oven temperature to 300 degrees and bake five minutes longer.
4. Remove pancake from oven, cut into wedges and serve at once topped with preferred toppings (syrup, preserves, confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar).
