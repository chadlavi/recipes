# Whole Wheat Pancakes

## Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 2 cup flour (1.5 white, 1/2 whole wheat)
* 2 cup milk
* 4 T oil
* 2 T sugar
* 6 tsp Baking Powder
* 1 tsp salt

## Directions
1. First thing you need to do is get your griddle heating. Turn flame on a medium setting.
2. Add egg to a mixing bowl. Beat egg lightly.
3. Add all the other ingredients and blend with a wire whisk.
4. Let rest for 3 minutes. The whole wheat flour will tend to thicken when it sets for a while.
5. Check your batter thickness and add milk as needed.
6. Test your skillet to see if it is hot enough. Drop a tiny bit of water on the hot surface. When the droplets skitter across your skillet it is hot.
7. Pour about 1/3 cup of your pancake batter on the skillet.
8. When the edges are looking a bit dry and you have bubbles over the top check the underneath. If it is nicely golden, turn to the other side. Cook until lightly browned.
