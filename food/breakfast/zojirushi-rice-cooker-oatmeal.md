* 1 rice-cooker cup steel cut oats
* 2-1/2 rice-cooker cups water

### Rolled oats
* 1 cup rolled oats
* 1.75 cups water

### Optional:
* 1 rice-cooker cup half & half
* 3-4 Tbsp brown sugar, maple syrup, agave syrup, or other sweetener
* 1/4 cup raisins, chopped dates, chopped figs, or other dried fruit

## Directions
1. Place oats and water in the inner cooking pan. If using dried fruit, add it.
2. Place the inner cooking pan in the main body of the rice cooker, plug in the
   unit, and cook using the "Porridge" setting.
3. When the rice cooker turns to Keep Warm, open the lid, stir and add the
   optional dairy and sugar.

   dairy products, as they may spoil.
