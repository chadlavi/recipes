# Hashbrowns

## Ingredients

* 1 pound (450g) russet potatoes, peeled
* 3 tablespoons (45ml) canola oil
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Shred potatoes on the largest holes of a box grater.
2. Wrap potatoes in a kitchen towel or several layers of cheesecloth and twist
   to squeeze out as much liquid as possible.
3. Transfer potatoes to a plate lined with 2 layers of paper towels. Cook in a
   microwave on high for 2 minutes.
4. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. When oil
   shimmers, add shredded potato. Season with a large pinch of salt and pepper.
   Using a spatula, press potato into an even layer. Cook until golden brown on
   the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip potatoes with spatula and brown on the
   other side, about 2 minutes longer. Remove and drain on a paper towelâ€“lined
   plate. Serve immediately.
