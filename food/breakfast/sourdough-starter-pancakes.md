# Sourdough Pancakes

## Ingredients
* 2 cups fresh sourdough starter
* 1 egg
* 3 Tbsp. sugar
* 2 Tbsp. oil
* 1 tsp. baking soda
* 2-4 Tbsp. milk, coconut milk, or water
* Butter or coconut oil for frying

## Directions
1. Mix together sourdough starter, egg, sugar, oil and baking soda.
2. Add milk, coconut milk, or water to thin the batter to a pancake batter
   consistency. Begin with 2 tablespoons liquid and add more as needed, based on
   the consistency of your sourdough starter.
3. Heat a griddle over medium heat. Melt a slice of butter or coconut oil on the
   griddle. Once the griddle is hot, add 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake.
   Cook until golden brown; flip and cook the other side.
