# Teresa Finney's Grandma's Chilaquiles

Grandma's Chilaquiles with a Twist  
(The "twist" here is that I omitted the shredded chicken for chorizo. I know this is the second recipe I've sent that uses chorizo but it might be the most beautiful and delicious ingredient I have ever used.) This will serve about 4.

## Ingredients

* Corn tortillas, about 7 cut into fourths.
* Vegetable oil, maybe an inch of oil in the pan.
* Mole sauce about 1/3 cup enough to coat the tortillas
* 4 eggs, scrambled or fried
* Dried chorizo, about 6 ounces
* cheese (I use both sharp cheddar and Cotija
* Salt, pepper to taste and I like to use dried oregano in this dish, about two teaspoons I guess.

## Directions

1. Heat a medium to large skillet over medium heat and add the oil. Add the tortillas once the oil is heated, stirring frequently.
2. Once tortillas are slightly crispy, transfer them to a plate with a paper towel to dry them of excess oil. Add the enchilada sauce to the pan, add the chorizo and stir until lightly sautéed and the chorizo is coated in the sauce.
3. Add the tortillas back to the pan and stir together with the chorizo. Typically, this is where you would add scrambled eggs to the skillet if you are doing scrambled. If you are doing fried eggs, you can fry them up in a separate pan. Excellent toppings with this dish are: salsa, sour cream, cilantro, sliced jalapeño and of course, my other true love, avocado slices.
