you will need

- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 or 2 Tablespoons of butter (how buttery do you like it?) and
- a CAST IRON skillet- accept no substitutes.

here's what you do

combine flour, milk, sugar, eggs - stir or beat until smooth.
heat up your oven to 425 deg. F. 

melt the butter in the cast iron skillet on low heat (don't burn the butter) and make sure to coat the sides of the skillet as well, as the batter will climb the sides

once the butter is all melted- turn the heat up to medium/high and pour in the batter. have a timer ready on hand. cook the batter on the stovetop in the skillet for ONLY 60 SECONDS. too much and it will be too tough.

put inside the heated 425 deg oven and cook for 11-12 minutes. towards the end- keep checking on it. the outside edges will get a little dark brown, but you want the puffed up parts in the middle to get golden brown. don't let the edges get burned

remove and marvel at the DUTCH BABY's golden brown puffed goodness. it will deflate in about 30 seconds, so enjoy it while you got it

topping suggestions

- regular fruit preserves
- Nutella (!!! my current fav topping)
