# Dutch Baby Pancake
tonyb's recipe

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup milk, room temperature
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 3 eggs, room temperature
- 2 Tablespoons of butter

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F with your cast iron skillet in the oven.
2. Combine flour, milk, sugar, eggs in a blender (or by hand in a bowl) until smooth.
3. Once it's preheated, remove cast iron pan from oven and set on low heat on the stovetop. Melt the butter in the cast iron pan on low heat (don't burn the butter) and make sure to coat the sides of the skillet as well, as the batter will climb the sides.
4. Once the butter is melted, turn the heat up to medium/high and pour in the batter. Have a timer ready on hand. Cook the batter on the stovetop in the skillet for **ONLY 60 SECONDS**. Too much and it will be too tough to inflate in the oven.
5. Move the pan to the preheated oven and cook for 11-12 minutes. Towards the end, keep checking on it. The outside edges will get a little dark brown, but you want the puffed up parts in the middle to get golden brown. Don't let the edges burn.
6. Remove and marvel at the DUTCH BABY's golden brown puffed goodness. It will deflate in about 30 seconds, so enjoy it while you got it.
