# 茶碗蒸し / Chawanmushi (Microwave)

Dave Chang's recipe. Makes 1 serving.

## Ingredients

### For 1 serving

- 1/2 cup (115ml) cold Dashi (or 1/2 cup water + 1/2 tsp hondashi)
- 1 egg
- 1/2 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp agave syrup

### For 2 servings

- 1 cup + 2 tbsp (270ml) cold dashi stock (or 1 cup 2 tbsp water + 1 1/4 hondashi)
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 1.5 tsp agave

### Optional toppings
- chili crisp
- sliced green onion
- sesame oil

## Directions

1. Prepare dashi if necessary. Be sure it is cold.
2. Whisk together the eggs, soy sauce, and agave syrup.
3. Slowly whisk in the dashi, stirring constantly.
4. Pour into a microwaveable bowl. 
5. Cook...
   1. For one serving: Cook in the microwave at Power Level 3 for 5-7 minutes
   2. For 2 servings: Cook in the microwave at Power Level 5 for 11-13 minutes
6. The custeard should be barely set and jiggle uniformly when gently moved like flan or creme caramel. If the custard looks too soupy in the center, add 30 seconds at the same power level until barely set, but be careful not to overcook.
7. Add toppings, if desired, and serve.
