# Nancy's Salad from Sweetgreens

## Ingredients
* Romaine lettuce
* Kale
* Cherry tomatoes
* Cucumber
* Red onion
* Cooked grains or legumes (faro, wheat berries, chickpeas, beans)
* Shaved parmesan cheese
* 3/4 cup olive oil
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* Dried oregano
* Dijon mustard
* Cured Genoa salami
* Pickled celery

## Directions
1. Clean all the fresh vegetables. Chop kale and romaine; slice half-moons of cucumber; dice the onion; halve the cherry tomatoes. 
2. Slice salami into batons, then slide those lengthwise into thin rectangles.
3. Mix olive oil, red wine vinegar, a generous pinch of dried oregano, a spoonful of mustard, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of fresh black pepper in a jar with a watertight screwtop lid. Shake vigorously to make vinaigrette. It should emulsify easily.
4. Add a 50/50 mix of romaine and kale to a large salad bowl. Drizzle with vinaigrette.
5. Add a scoop of cooked grains/legumes. Next to that, add some cucumber, tomato, and onion. Next to that, add some of the sliced salami; finally, add some of the pickled celery. Sprinkle shaved parmesan over all.
6. Drizzle a little more vinaigrette over the whole salad, then use tongs or utensils to toss together vigorously. Eat immediately.
