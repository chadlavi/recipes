# Farro & charred corn salad with salted almonds and queso fresco

Serves 4

## Ingredients

PRODUCE

- 1/2 small red onion
- 4 ears corn
- 1 cup mint or basil leaves
  
DAIRY

- 4 ounces queso fresco or feta cheese
  
PANTRY

- Kosher salt
- 1.25 cups farro
- 1/3 cup sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 cup roasted, salted almonds or hazelnuts
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Cook the farro: Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Season well with salt as you would pasta water. Add 1.25 cups farro and boil until cooked through and al dente but not mushy, 20 to 35 minutes. Taste as you go to determine doneness.
2. Meanwhile, pickle the onion:
   - In a large bowl, whisk together 1/3 cup sherry vinegar, 1 tablespoon honey, 1/3 cup olive oil, and 1 teaspoon salt.
   - Peel and thinly slice 1/2 small red onion through the root end. Add to the dressing and toss to combine.
   - Once the farro is al dente, drain it in a fine-mesh strainer or colander and rinse with cold water to cool it down. Add the drained farro to the bowl with the pickled onions, tossing to combine.
3. Char the corn: Shuck 4 ears of corn. Heat a large dry cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for several minutes. Add the corn and cook, rotating every few minutes, until charred in spots and bright yellow, 11 to 13 minutes. Transfer the corn to a cutting board to cool. Working one at a time, stand the corn stem-end down in the bowl of farro. Cut the kernels off the cob, starting at the top and working down. Repeat with the remaining corn.
4. Assemble the salad:
   - Crumble 4 ounces queso fresco into the farro mixture; tossing to combine.
   - Roughly chop 1/2 cup roasted, salted almonds, then toss into the farro mixture to combine.
   - Tear 1 cup mint leaves into smaller pieces and toss everything together.
   - Season with lots of black pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding more salt or vinegar as necessary until it all tastes harmonious.
5. Serve: Serve at room temperature or cover and transfer to the fridge to chill and then eat coldâ€”both ways are delicious, and this salad is perfect as leftovers.
