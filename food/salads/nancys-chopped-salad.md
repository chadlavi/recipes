## Ingredients

### Vinaigrette ingredients

* 2 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons dried oregano (yes really that much)
* Freshly squeezed juice from 1/2 lemon (1 tablespoon), or more to taste
* 2 medium cloves garlic, 1 smashed flat and 1 grated
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
* 1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil

### Salad ingredients

* 1/2 small red onion, cut in half from top to bottom
* 1 head (22 ounces) iceberg lettuce
* 1 head (11 ounces) radicchio
* 1 pint small, sweet cherry tomatoes, such as Sun Golds or Sweet 100s, cut into quarters
* Kosher salt
* 1 1/2 cups no-salt-added chickpeas, drained
* 1/4 pound aged provolone, cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices, then cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips
* 1/4 pound Genoa salami, cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices, then cut into 1/4-inch-wide strips
* 5 pepperoncini (stems discarded), cut into thin slices (about 1/4 cup)
* Freshly squeezed juice from 1/2 lemon (1 tablespoon), or more to taste
* Dried oregano (preferably Sicilian oregano on the branch), for sprinkling

## Directions

### Vinaigrette directions

1. Whisk together the vinegar, oregano, lemon juice, the smashed garlic and grated garlic and the salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes (to marinate the oregano).
2. Add the oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly to form an emulsified vinaigrette. Taste for seasoning, and add salt or lemon juice as needed.

The yield is a generous 1 1/2 cups; you'll use up to 1/2 cup for this salad, and the remainder can be refrigerated for another use (up to 3 days).

### Salad directions

1. Separate the layers of the onion and stack two or three layers on top of one another, then cut them lengthwise into 1/16-inch-wide strips. Repeat with the remaining onion layers. Place the onion in a small bowl of ice water to sit while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Drain the onion and pat dry with paper towels before adding to the salad.
2. Cut the iceberg lettuce in half through the core. Remove and discard the outer leaves, and discard the core. Separate the lettuce leaves, stack two or three leaves on top of one another, then cut them lengthwise into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Repeat with the remaining leaves; thinly slice the radicchio in the same way. Cut the tomatoes in half, season them with salt to taste, and toss gently.
3. Combine the lettuce, radicchio, tomatoes, chickpeas, provolone, salami, pepperoncini and onion in a large, wide bowl. Season with salt to taste, and toss to thoroughly combine. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of the vinaigrette over the salad, then sprinkle with the lemon juice; toss gently to coat the salad evenly. Taste, and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette, plus salt and/or lemon juice as needed.
4. Transfer the salad to a large platter or divide it among individual plates, piling it like a mountain. Sprinkle the dried oregano leaves on top and serve.
