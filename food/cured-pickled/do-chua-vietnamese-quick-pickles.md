# Vietnamese Pickled Vegetables (Do Chua)

## Ingredients
* 1/4 lb. cucumber, julienned
* 1/4 lb. daikon, peeled and julienned
* 1/4 lb. carrots, peeled and julienned
* 1 tsp kosher or sea salt
* 1 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
* 2 tbsps + 2 tsps sugar
* 1 cup water

## Directions
1. Make sure the vegetables are fairly dry (pat them dry) so they donâ€™t dilute the pickling liquid with excess water. 
2. Combine the vinegar, salt, sugar, and water together until the sugar dissolves. 
3. Place the vegetables in a jar large enough to fit them all and pour the pickling liquid into the jar so that all of the vegetables are submerged. 
4. Store them sealed in the jar in the refrigerator for 5 days for best flavor.
