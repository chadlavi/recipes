# 감자샐러드 / Gamja Salad (Korean potato salad)

## Ingredients

- 1 Kirby cucumber, deseeded and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
- 1/2 medium red onion, very finely diced
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
- 1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
- 1 large russet potato (about 1 pound), peeled and cut - into 2-inch cubes
- 1 large egg
- 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon mayonnaise (preferably Hellmann’s)
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine the cucumber, red onion and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Set aside to sweat slightly.
2. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the carrot and cook until tender-crisp, 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon or fine-mesh sieve and set aside.
3. Add the cubed potato and egg to the boiling water. Cook the egg for 10 minutes and the potatoes until fork-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. While the potato finishes cooking, run the hard-boiled egg under cold tap water. Peel the egg, finely chop it, then add it to a medium bowl. When the potato is cooked, transfer to the bowl with the egg and mash with a fork until uniform.
4. Add the mayonnaise, sugar and vinegar to the mashed potato mixture and stir to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Squeeze the salted cucumber and red onion with your hands (discarding any liquid), and fold them into the potato and egg mixture along with the cooked carrot.
5. To serve, scoop the potato salad onto a plate using an ice cream scoop, and eat warm or at room temperature. (To store for later, transfer to a resealable container and keep in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. This salad even tastes great cold, straight out of the fridge.)
