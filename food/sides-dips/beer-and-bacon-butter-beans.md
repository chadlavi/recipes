# Beer and Bacon Butter Beans

## Ingredients

* 8 slices thick bacon, chopped
* 2 cans white beans of your choice, rinsed and drained (obviously, if you can, soak 3 cups of white beans over night to use, but I never think that far ahead, so here I am)
* 1 large shallot, minced
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken stock (I used Knorr Homestyle Stock)
* 1 1/2 cups amber ale, such as Newcastle (I used an IPA and unless you really love the bitterness in most IPAs, use a maltier beer)
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 small sprig rosemary
* juice of half a lemon
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. In a heavy bottomed pot or pan with a lid, cook your chopped bacon over medium-high heat, until crispy. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and place on a plate to use later.
2. Turn the heat to medium and cook the shallots in the bacon fat, until translucent, about 5 minutes, then add in the garlic, and stir for 1 minute. Add in the chicken stock, beer, honey, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and rosemary sprig. Bring to a boil, then cover and place in the oven for about 2 hours, until the beans are tender and some of the liquid has reduced. Stir in the 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter, taste, and season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve alongside some brats, ribs, chicken, or even on their own.
