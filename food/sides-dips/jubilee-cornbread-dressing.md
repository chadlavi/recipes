- Double recipe [Cornbread](../bread/jubilee-cornbread), crumbled 1½ cups dried bread crumbs, toasted
- 2.5 teaspoons dried sage
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
- 2 teaspoons salt
- I teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 stick (4 ounces) butter
- 1 cup finely diced onion

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Generously butter a deep 13 × 9-inch baking pan.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the cornbread crumbles, bread crumbs, sage, thyme, poultry seasoning, marjoram, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
3. In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and celery and sauté until softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds longer. Cool slightly. Gently stir the vegetables into the cornbread mixture, then stir in the eggs.
4. Drizzle the turkey stock over the cornbread mixture, tossing with a fork until the mixture is just moistened. Spoon the dressing into the baking pan and cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, rotate the pan, and bake until hot, set, and crusty, about 30 minutes longer.
5. Serve with either giblet gravy or chile-pecan sauce.
