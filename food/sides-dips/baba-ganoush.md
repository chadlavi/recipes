# Baba Ganoush

## Ingredients

* 2 large eggplants
* 1/2c tahini
* 4 cloves garlic
* cilantro
* salt
* olive oil

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375ÂºF.
2. Prick eggplants in a few places with a fork. Char whole eggplants over gas stove until well burnt all over. Let cool enough to handle.
3. While eggplants cool, peel and halve 4 cloves of garlic. Remove stems from the eggplants and split lengthwise. Lay 4 garlic halves and 5-10 cilantro leaves inside each eggplant then close them back up. Bake in a covered pan about 20-30 minutes, or until eggplant flesh is soft enough that a butter knife meets no resistance.
4. Let eggplants cool enough to handle. Remove skins from eggplants, set aside. Add eggplant flesh, 1/2c tahini, dash of salt and a splash of olive oil to a large bowl. Chop eggplant skins very finely and add to bowl. Mash and mix with a large spoon until a smooth consistency is achieved.
