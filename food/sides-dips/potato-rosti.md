# Potato Rösti

# Ingredients
* 1 sprig fresh oregano
* 2 cups cool water
* 4 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 2 pounds), peeled
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 cup schmaltz (chicken fat)

# Directions
1. Wrap the sprig of fresh oregano in cheesecloth, tie the ends with twine, and pound it a few times with the back of a knife to release the oils. Put it in a large bowl with the water.
2. Shred the potatoes on the large holes of a box grater. Divide them into three portions. Take one third of the potatoes and soak them in the oregano water for 30 minutes. Place the remaining potatoes in a clean tea towel and squeeze lightly to remove some of their natural juices. Transfer to a large bowl and press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the potatos. Drain the potatoes soaking in the oregano water, discard the oregano, and put the potatoes in the tea towel. Squeeze hard to extract all the liquid, then add to the large bowl containing the shredded (unsoaked) potatoes. Add the salt and mix well to combine.
3. In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat, heat 2 tablespoons of schmaltz. Spread the potatoes evenly in the skillet, gently pat down, and cook for about 20 minutes or until golden brown on the bottom (gently lift one edge to check).
4. Cover skillet with a large inverted plate and then turn the pan over to transfer the rösti onto the plate. Add the remaining schmaltz to the skillet, then slide the rösti back into the skillet, cooked side up; cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 20 minutes more. Transfer to a cutting board and cut into wedges to serve.
