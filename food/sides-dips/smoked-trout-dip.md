# Smoked Trout dip

Heidi Mueller's smoked trout dip

## Ingredients

- 1 can smoked trout
- Mayonnaise
- Dill
- Shallots or red onion
- Whole grain mustard
- Lemon juice
- Fresh ground black pepper
- Celery

## Directions

> I think I play around, but mostly itâ€™s canned smoked trout, mayo, dill, shallots or red onion, whole grain mustard, and a small squeeze of lemon juice. And fresh pepper! If you have some celery lying around, I like to throw a little in for some extra crunch.
