## Ingredients

- one large round cabbage (purple or green)
- 4 tablespoons olive oil or schmaltz
- 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh pepper

- 2 shallots, sliced
- 4–8 garlic cloves, rough chopped
- 1 cup veggie or chicken stock
- 1/2 cup wine (red for purple cabbage, white for green cabbage)

- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Cut cabbage in half, core, then cut into quarters, then eights-so you have 8 equal sized wedges.
3. Heat oil in an extra large, wide oven-proof skillet or (you’ll need a lid). Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to the oil. Ad a pinch of chili flakes, and swirl over medium high heat. Sear the wedges of cabbage in batches, setting to the side on a plate, when lightly browned.
4. Turn heat to medium. Add the shallots and garlic to the empty pan and give a stir, and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the broth and wine and 1/4 teaspoon salt, bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Add bay leaves, & thyme.
5. Turn heat off and arrange cabbage, overlapping in a circle. Drizzle the cabbage with 1 tablespoon vinegar. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly and place in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.
6. Check cabbage with a fork, they should be meltingly tender.
