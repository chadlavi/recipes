# Sweet potato rolls

Makes 15 rolls. Perfect holiday rolls.

## Ingredients

- 1 small orange-fleshed sweet potato (6 ounces), peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
- Salt
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing and about 3 tablespoons melted butter for brushing the rolls
- 4 cups/512 grams all-purpose flour, plus more as needed
- 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast (1 envelope)
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs

## Directions

1. In a small saucepan, combine the sweet potato with enough water to cover. Add 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn down the heat to medium and gently boil until the sweet potato is very tender when pierced with a knife, 10 to 13 minutes.
2. Drain and transfer the sweet potato to a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher or fork. Add the buttermilk and Â¼ cup of the butter.
3. With a stand mixer, beat the sweet potato mixture with a paddle attachment at medium-low speed until fairly smooth, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, yeast, sugar, eggs and 1.5 teaspoons salt and mix on medium-low speed, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed with a spatula, until the dough is smooth and sticky and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Add a little more flour if the dough is very sticky. This can take as long as 15 minutes.
4. Grease the inside of a large bowl with butter. Transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot for about 1.5 hours, or until it has more than doubled in size.
5. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with more butter. Place the dough on a clean, ungreased surface and divide it into 15 equal pieces, each weighing about 65 grams. Working with one piece of dough at a time, cup each piece beneath your palm and work in quick, circular motions to form a tight ball, with only a tiny seam along the bottom. Arrange the dough balls in three evenly spaced rows of five within the greased pan.
6. Brush the balls with butter, loosely cover the pan and set aside in a warm place until the balls have turned puffy, doubled in size, and fill the pan, about 1 hour.
   1. ALTERNATIVELY: after loosely covering the pan, refrigerate overnight. Remove from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before baking, but ideally more.
7. About 15 minutes before the rolls are done rising, heat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the rolls until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack. Brush the rolls gently with a little more butter.
8. Let cool for 10 minutes, and then turn out the rolls onto the rack and invert again so they are bottom-side down. Let cool for about 20 minutes before serving.
