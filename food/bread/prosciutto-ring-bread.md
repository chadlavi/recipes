## Directions
### 1. Mix the dough
#### Food Processor Method
In the bowl of a food processor ﬁtted with the metal blade, combine the ﬂour, malt and process for a few seconds to mix. Then add the salt (this keeps the yeast from coming in direct contact with the salt, which would kill it) and process again for a few seconds. With the motor running, gradually pour in the cold water and lard. Process for 45 seconds after the dough comes together. It should be slightly tacky (sticky). 
Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter and lightly flour the dough. Press it into a rectangle and sprinkle it with the prosciutto. Roll up the dough and knead it to incorporate the meat evenly. (The dough will weigh about 1 3/4 pounds/795 grams.) Dust the dough lightly with flour and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to relax for 20 minutes. 

#### Mixer Method 
In the mixer bowl, whisk together the flour, malt (or honey or sugar), yeast, and black pepper. Then whisk in the salt (this prevents the yeast from coming into direct Contact with the salt, which would kill it). With the dough hook, on low speed (#2 if using a KitchenAid), add the water and lard and mix for about 1 minute, until the flour is moistened. Knead the dough on medium speed (#4 KitchenAid) for 7 minutes. 
Add the meat and mix on low speed (#2 KitchenAid) for 1 minute or until evenly incorporated. The dough should be very elastic and jump back when pressed with a fingertip. It should still be a little tacky (sticky) but not cling to your fingers. If the dough is very sticky, knead in a little flour. If it is not sticky at all, spray it with a little water and knead it in. (The dough will weigh about 1 3/4 pounds/795 grams.) 
Dust the dough lightly with flour and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to relax for 20 minutes. 

#### Hand Method 
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, malt (or honey or sugar), pepper, and yeast. Then whisk in the salt (this keeps the yeast from coming into direct contact with the salt, which would kill it). Add the water and lard and stir, with a wooden spoon or your hand, until the flour is moistened. 
Empty the dough onto a counter and knead it for 10 minutes or until it is very elastic and jumps back when pressed with a fingertip. Knead in the meat. The dough should be a little tacky (sticky) but not cling to your fingers. if it is very sticky, knead in a little flour. (The dough will weigh about 1 3/4 pounds/795 grams.) 
Dust the dough lightly with flour and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to relax for 20 minutes. 

#### Bread Machine Method 
In the bread machine container, place the water, lard, salt, malt (or honey or flour, black pepper, and yeast, in that order. Put it through the dough cycle (mix 3 minutes, knead 5 minutes). Let the dough rest for 20 minutes.
Add the meat and do a second dough cycle (mix 3 minutes, knead 5 minutes.) The dough should be a little tacky (sticky) but not cling to your ﬁngers. If necessary, remove it from the machine and knead in a little more ﬂour (The dough will weigh about 1 3/4 pounds/795 grams.)

### 2. Shape the dough and let it rise. 
Turn the dough out onto a lightly ﬂoured counter, if it’s not already on the counter. Roll it into an 18-inch-long rope. Shape it into a ring, overlapping ends by 2 inches, and press lightly to seal them; the ring will be about 7 inches in diameter and 1 1/4 inches high, with a 3-inch hole in the center.
Set the bread on the Silpain or parchment and cover it with a large container or oiled plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise (ideally at 75° to 80°F) until almost doubled, about 1 hour. It will be almost 9 inches across by 1 1/2inches high, and when it is pressed gently with a ﬁngertip, the depression will very slowly fill in.

### 3. Preheat the oven. 
Preheat the oven to 450°F 1 hour before baking. Have an oven shelf at the lowest level and place a baking stone or baking sheet on it, and a cast-iron skillet or sheet pan on the ﬂoor of the oven, before preheating.  

### 4. Glaze and bake the bread. 
Shortly before baking, brush the dough all over with the melted bacon fat or butter. (Do not slash the dough.) Using the Silpain liner, lift the ring onto the hot baking stone or hot baking sheet; or use a peel if it is on parchment. Toss 1/2 cup of ice cubes into the pan beneath and immediately close the door. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn down the heat to 400°F and continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the bread is deep golden brown (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 211°F). Halfway through baking, with a heavy pancake turner, lift the bread from the Silpain or parchment and set it directly on the stone, turning it around as you do so for even baking. When the bread is baked, turn off the oven, prop the door slightly ajar, and leave the bread in the oven for 5 minutes.

### 5. Glaze and cool the bread. 
Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a wire rack. Brush with another coat of melted bacon or butter, and cool completely. The texture of this bread is most appealing when torn rather than cut.

Store This bread stays fresh for 2 days at room temperature.
