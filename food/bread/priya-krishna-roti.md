# Priya Krishna's roti

## Ingredients
* 1 cup atta (wheat flour)
* 3/4 cup water
* salt
* chile powder

## Directions
1. Combine the flour, a pinch of salt, a pinch of red chile powder, and the water (or enough to just come together in a ball). Roll into a ball and let rest at least 20 minutes in a covered bowl.
2. Preheat a small pan on the stovetop over medium-low heat.
3. Separate the dough into 6 even pieces and roll each piece into a ball
4. Dunk each in flour, press down on the counter, then roll out while continuously rotating to achieve an even thickness. Roll to about 1/8in thick.
5. Heat each roti in the small pan for a few minutes on each side until it's slightly hardened/curled at the edges and has some small blonde blisters forming
6. After each roti is done in the pan, use tongs to move it over an open gas stovetop flame. The Roti should rapidly puff up like a balloon. Continuously rotate and flip to achieve even blistering/charring. Ensure that there are no uncooked spots left.
7. Spread a small amount of ghee on finished rotis and serve hot
