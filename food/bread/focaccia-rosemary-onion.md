# Focaccia with rosemary and onion

## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided, plus more
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour plus more
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt plus more
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1/3 cup thinly sliced red onion
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Lightly oil a large bowl; set aside. Combine 1 3/4 cups flour, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, sugar, yeast, and 3/4 cup water in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low speed for 5 minutes. Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl. Increase speed to medium and mix for 6 minutes (dough will be very soft). Form dough into a ball. (Alternatively, vigorously stir ingredients to form a ragged dough. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Knead dough, sprinkling with flour by tablespoonfuls as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth, 4–5 minutes. This will result in a denser bread than mixer method.) Transfer to prepared bowl. Cover; let stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Chill overnight.
2. Brush a large rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp. oil. Stretch and press dough on sheet into a rectangle slightly smaller than the sheet. Brush dough with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; let stand in a warm, draft-free area until dough has almost doubled in size, 1 1/2–2 hours.
3. Preheat oven to 500°. Remove plastic wrap and dimple dough with your fingertips. Scatter onion, rosemary, and oregano over dough; season with salt and pepper. Bake focaccia until golden brown, 10–15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before slicing.
