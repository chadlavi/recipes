# Cornbread (from _Jubilee_)

Can be doubled for use in [Cornbread dressing](../sides-dips/jubilee-cornbread-dressing)

## Ingredients

- 1 cup cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in the egg and buttermilk until just mixed.
3. Place the butter in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet and heat in the oven until the butter is foamy. Swirl the butter around to coat the bottom and insides of the hot pan, then pour the hot butter into the batter and stir until well mixed. The batter will be thick. Immediately pour the batter into the hot buttered pan and return to the oven. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes.
